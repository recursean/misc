[Intro]
Yep, yeah
Okay

[Pre-Chorus]
(These mothafuckas)
Any day in the week, every month, all year round
(These mothafuckas crazy) No danger to me
The game made me a beast, and I gotta eat
(These mothafuckas) Think this shit come easy
No handouts, no mothafuckin' freebies
(These mothafuckas lazy)
I'ma be awake at my wake (Yeah) (Count your blessings)
Fuck twenty-four seven, shit is...

[Chorus]
Twenty-five eight (No sleep)
Twenty-five eight (All day, every day)
Twenty-five eight (Gotta eat)
Twenty-five eight (Too much money to be made)
Twenty-five eight (This shit ain't free)
Twenty-five eight (Yeah) (Can't afford to wait no more)
Twenty-five eight (Tell God, "Good mornin'," when I wake up)
(But one day I'm gon' rule the world)

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Never taken shit for granted
Spend a lot of days in this game 'fore I ran it (Twenty-five eight)
When the money gone, hoes vanish
(Dorothy) We ain't in Kansas no more (Yeah)
Bitches won't stop callin' my line
But I'm too busy turnin' water to wine
Lot on my mind, type of things happen all of the time
You gotta get yours, but me, I gotta get mine
Homie, I made it from the basement to
Gettin' faded on stage with Snoop
It's the capital M-A-C-M-I
Double-L, don't forget the E-R
It's plenty room for you and your crew
M-O-S-T-D-O-P-E, that's who we are
The flow cold, get a bubble goose
Gotta old soul, but the money new
There's a difference between hobbies and careers
For Heaven's sake I had it up to here with...

[Pre-Chorus]
(These mothafuckas)
Any day in the week, every month, all year round
(These mothafuckas crazy) No danger to me
The game made me a beast, and I gotta eat
(These mothafuckas) Think this shit come easy
No handouts, no mothafuckin' freebies
(These mothafuckas lazy)
I'ma be awake at my wake (Yeah) (Count your blessings)
Fuck twenty-four seven, shit is...

[Chorus]
Twenty-five eight (No sleep)
Twenty-five eight (All day, every day)
Twenty-five eight (Gotta eat)
Twenty-five eight (Too much money to be made)
Twenty-five eight (This shit ain't free)
Twenty-five eight (Yeah) (Can't afford to wait no more)
Twenty-five eight (Tell God, "Good mornin'," when I wake up)
(But one day I'm gon' rule the world)

[Verse 2]
If you lookin' for a king then you found one
Popped out of my mother placenta with a crown on
Gotta new bitch, keep the frown on
She tell me I need to grow up
I tell her she need to get on my level and show respect to the motherfucker just cuttin' the check
She ain't gonna be around long and that's fine
For now we naked on the couch, watchin' movies with the sound on this time
But never mind, that's another story
For a better time, when it's better for me
Cold dough burger, shit is 40
Might fuck around, pour a four in a 40
Now it's four in the mornin'
She out cold, sleepin' on the couch with her mouth wide, me, I'm still goin'
Fuck everybody but us
This why I can't trust...

[Pre-Chorus]
(These mothafuckas)
Any day in the week, every month, all year round
(These mothafuckas crazy) No danger to me
The game made me a beast, and I gotta eat
(These mothafuckas) Think this shit come easy
No handouts, no mothafuckin' freebies
(These mothafuckas lazy)
I'ma be awake at my wake (Yeah) (Count your blessings)
Fuck twenty-four seven, shit is...

[Chorus]
Twenty-five eight (No sleep)
Twenty-five eight (All day, every day)
Twenty-five eight (Gotta eat)
Twenty-five eight (Too much money to be made)
Twenty-five eight (This shit ain't free)
Twenty-five eight (Can't afford to wait no more)
Twenty-five eight (Tell God, "Good mornin'," when I wake up)
(But one day I'm gon' rule the world)

[Outro]
Twenty-five eight
