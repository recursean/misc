[Intro]
They wanna know why I do it?
It's actually pretty simple
Look

[Verse 1]
I do it for the music
I do it for the love
I do it cause my purpose is way more than just because
I do it for the soul
I do it for the funk
I do it for the people who used say that I'm a punk

I do it for the haters
I do it for the fans
I do it for the people who helped make me who I am
I do it for everyone
The world, the water up to the sand
The quiet kid in your school who wanna just be the man

I do it because I can
I do it because I love it
There ain't a better feeling than to know your feature's done it
Cause now, this my job, this what I live for
Every day the best day ever, still tryna get more

So I never take a day off
Every single game, gotta treat it like a playoff
Buckle up, we bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna know what you doing and why you doing it
We living life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

Everybody wanna know what you doing and why you doing it
We living life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

[Verse 2]
I do it for the generation, all the kids who bout to grow up, run shit
Put our thumbs in the air and the blunt lit
Feeling like I can do it in my sleep
But I'm working, getting better, thinking bout what's out my reach

Hoping that it's nothing but I'm hoping for discussion
How I crashed into the game and nobody seen me coming
They saw a youngin who just love what he does
A brain behind the face and a heart behind the buzz

I keep it real, ain't got a reason to lie
Just mention me when your favorite MCs come to mind
I'll bless a rhyme if you give me the time
In Pittsburgh, I just want my whole city behind me

Cause "we" is who I do this for
Soundtrack to like, this a movie score
Buckle up, we bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna know what you doing and why you doing it
We living life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

Everybody wanna know what you doing and why you doing it
We living life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

[Verse 3]
Third verse:
Yeah, I do it
I ain't done yet
Do it for the crack of dawn and every time the sun set

You played all of your cards and got none left
I'm staying smart, strategic who'll come next
Yeah, I'm ready for it, prepared heavy for it
That's why I do what I do and I ain't ever bored

If life's a game, I got a better score
I guarantee Ima do this right here

I do this for the feeling that you get when you hear the perfect beat
You know exactly what to say and all your homies holler "preach!"
We bout to take off, heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna know what you doing and why you doing it
We living life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

Everybody wanna know what you doing and why you doing it
We living life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash

[Outro]
Yeah
My thumb stay up
Cause, at the end of the day, I know why I do it
We do it to be happy
We do it cause it's all love, you know?
Don't be mad at me
Hey!
