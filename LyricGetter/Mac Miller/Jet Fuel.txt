[Part I]

[Intro]
Stopper, to every DJ, dem haffi talk to me proper
Mi come a dancehall, mi a go kill you with di lingua
Galang Cutty Ranks 'cause you full up of a stamina
Anyweh me go, Lord, a roots and culture
One man me praise, a di Almighty, Jah Jah
Jah Jah give me strength and him give me di power
That's why Cutty Ranking, full up of stamina
Come a dancehall, mi a go kill you with di...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, used to wanna be a superhero
Flyin' round with a cape catching bad guys
Now my head underwater
But I ain’t in the shower and I ain’t getting baptized (No)
To the good and the bad times (Bad times)
All the cuts, broken bones, and the black eyes (Black eyes)
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y’all can’t tell me nuttin' no more
Came from the basement under that floor (Floor)
You don’t come close, y’all don’t even know I’m the G.O.A.T
Y’all don’t need to know how I go
'Cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I’m in the post
Yeah, my girl too clutch to choke (Hmm)
And I ain’t calling it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
While I keep talking that shit, it’s like this (Hmm)
Liquor still in my cup (My cup)
Get faded when I wake up (Wake up)
'Cause everything is too much (Too much)
So what? (So what?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up this morning with a bright idea (Smoke)
Maybe I can exist forever right here (Let it run)
Yeah, okay, okay

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, well, I'ma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I’m in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel

[Verse 2]
Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss
Never put a limit on the high stakes
Try to pull my card, tell them "Go Fish"
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy from my—(Uh, oh)
Yeah, I don't say nothing that I don't know
Jumping out the womb wearing Polo
Everybody wanna jump in but I'm old school
Lone wolf, take 'em on solo
Yeah, I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody!)
I don't need to be nobody (I don't need to be nobody!)
I'm just doing my thing
Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side
I'm pulling up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect (no)
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet (God damn)
Feeling like they forget, I let it slide, this time
Like 25 years I've been high and no less (Yes)
Shit, I know, I don't guess
Rather glow, I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, well I'ma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I’m in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel

[Part II: Now Is Only Now]

Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Fallin' in deep
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear
