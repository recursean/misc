[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah
I be eatin' that Pink Slime
Hahaha
Here we go

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Got my chick makin' drinks with that cream (Cream)
While I'm takin' sips of that lean (Lean)
Life ain't a bitch, well, if you make a wish
You might break a record like me (Me)
Got a mil' at the age of nineteen (Woo!)
But I may just give that back (Woo!)
To show my friends I could do it again
If I started all from scratch, huh
All I do is rap (Rap)
You could run and tell them hoes that (That)
More pipe than a plumber, it's nice with no rubber
She like when I fuck her like that (That)
This rap's what I do, but I been fly, been fly
You're now inside of my sick mind
That Pink Slime, that Pink Slime

[Hook: Mac Miller]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Go a hundred miles an hour (Woo!)
Riding 'round the city (Woo!)
Smoking on that sour (Sour)
C-C-Couple bad ones with me (With me)
Used to rock all my brother's clothes
Now, designer brands, got a bunch of those (Go, go, go)
Got a bunch of diamonds and a bunch of gold (Go, go, go, go)
Riding by the cops, I'm like fuck em' though (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Hoes turn red for that Hermès
I'm busting nuts on her fur vest
My life is like a circus
My head's a little unfurnished
She honor roll, she Dean's list
Her ass round like Venus
My penis in her cleavage
That freaky bitch need Jesus

[Hook: Mac Miller]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
I'm switchin' up my flows (Flows)
Selling out these shows (Shows)
Pop a bottle of Dom P
Then spill it all on my clothes (Oh)
Now I'm acting so grown (Grown)
Made a business all on my own
These labels calling my phone
But I made this business all on my own (Woo!)
Give me that bass, bitch, I'm a basehead
And I break shit 'til it make a mess (Ugh)
I wrote myself another blank check
I'm fucking it, need a AIDS test
Win the Heisman, I'm MVP (P)
Dan Marino, you Sandusky ('ky)
MC Hammer, they can't touch me (Me)
Skateboard P, he be on that beat (That beat)

[Hook: Mac Miller]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—
