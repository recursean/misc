[Intro: B-DuBB]
B-DuBB, Easy Mac
Who is—
Who is the man that taught ya how to rap and how to sell crack, boozes, maaaan?
Foolin', we get down like this

[Verse 1: B-DuBB]
Ay yo, it's like, check it
Beedie shot ya, whatcha gon' do?
Heatie pops ya
I'm sonnin' ya style, call me papa
Pop of a Glock, that's the sound when I drop ya
Stuff ya body parts in a locker
Runnin' from the cops, Willy Parker
And I ain't gonna walk on ya set get you wet
Cause ya set full of talkers
Straight snitches, I'll punch you in the face
Leave you with eight stithces, bitches I play viscous

[Verse 2: Easy Mac]
Title is inevitable, I'm incredible
Got lames hidin' behind frames like I was federal
The fuckin' general, suck up on my genitals
My flow's outta this world like I got some tentacles
I'm with the pencil to murder instrumentals
I'm spittin' ammunition, you better listen to potential
I'm fifteens years with no restrictions on the mental
My mind flows as I go, I follow where I'm sent to

[Verse 3: B-DuBB]
Me and Mac blow ya back when we writin' it
Or freestylin' on some ill, that's excitement
Keep a fat a sack and a gat at the side of him
And kiss ya snakes tryna take what I'm hidin' in
I spit it slick, so sick need a vitamin

Aim it at ya forehead, leavin' four dead
Bust in the door with lead and whores spread
I'm a warhead, looking for more head
Fuckin' on the floor til I gotta sore head
Pussy lips drippin' stingin' like a hornet
Kickin' bitches out the door in the mornin'
Rappers tryna spit it but the shit is corny
I ain't even wit it, man forreal

[Verse 4: Easy Mac]
I'm not the best in school but I'm set for college
Cause when the bitch give me brains, yo I get some knowledge
I keep a few close friends and the rest will tarnish
A few respectable rappers, the rest are garbage
I proceed to gain yardage, this ain't Dwayne Carter
I make it rain harder, game remain slaughter
My brain remains smarter and you stay retarded
You better add another name to today's departed

[Verse 5: B-DuBB]
I never wake up and lose my skill
I get baked up and use em, ew!
The music real and every day I be movin' bills
Makin' cake, hittin' jakes, puttin' dudes in jail

[Verse 6: Easy Mac]
And I'll tell you what they say right before they arrest you
Anything you say can and will be used against you
And even though they got no reason to resent you
They treat you like you got a set of criminal credentials
And me and B-DuBB are here to murder the game
We gon' spit off every minute until you heard of the name
We kickin' it exquisite, sittin' and gettin' lifted
Bangin' music until the neighbor's pissed and I'm evicted

[Verse 7: B-DuBB]
Cause I be gettin' verbs workin' until I hear them birds chirpin'
Yeah preferred first person in here, you heard certain
Flirtin' with the lyrical spheres, ya ears hurtin'
Merkin' every peer that appear, ya fears worsen

[Outro: B-DuBB]
I thought ya mothafuckas already knew
Easy Mac but his mackin' ain't easy
And next comin' up is Beedie
Kill the shit
