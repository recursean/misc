[Intro]
Yeah
Well God damn baby
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Down down sugar love, nothing ever good enough
You be out there with your friends, tell you keep that pussy tucked
Lookin' up, never lookin' down to the danger
Take your hand, will you leave the club with a stranger?
All I make is bangers and they pay the bills right
Ask you how you feelin', you just tell me that you feel right (Oh my God)
Is this real life or is this fantasy, love you like my family
Can it be, will it be, poems and soliloquies
You be chasin' mystery, while I be makin' history
Will you be Mrs. me, when I leave you missin' me
Distance make the heart grow fonder, I long for, her
And everything that she does, we love
My soul was dirty, got it cleaned up
Only the best for you, never the cheap stuff
Gotta leave ya, see ya when I see ya

[Chorus]
Downtown lookin' for my baby, every time she leave
It make my heart go crazy my love, make my heart go crazy my love (Wow, wow wow)
And do you get a little lonely (I do), want to see inside
Is there something you can show me? (I can show you)
Yeah, make my heart go crazy my love yeah (Wow, wow wow)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of, yeah (Can't get enough of you, baby)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of (I can't get enough)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Sweeter than cinnamon she sizzlin' hot
I may be trippin', I just figured I would give it a shot
Perfect of synonym, picturin' her image inside my thoughts
Wanna kick it with you, this the only life that we got
I hit your spot, lick your body then wax it Mr. Miyagi
Need a taste of you every single mornin', girl you my coffee
And I drink you up, stay in bed all day no point in gettin' up
Swear I can't get enough(No)
Girl you so different, brilliant, you one in a billion
Make everythin' simple in this crazy world innocent
There somethin' bout you so dangerous
You try to make it through this tainted blood
Feel like it's made for us
Do you fantasize a feelin' so strong
That when it slip into your finger tips, you try to hold on
For your life, I've been wrong I've been right
But when I saw you tonight, you made me reconsider all that I know to be true
I need you back, I get that pussy wetter than a stream or river
A little weed and liquor, expensive cuisine for dinner
I can change your life drastically and hold you down like gravity
But if you need me I'm

[Chorus]
Downtown lookin' for my baby, every time she leave
It make my heart go crazy my love, make my heart go crazy my love (Wow, wow wow)
And do you get a little lonely (I do), want to see inside
Is there something you can show me? (I can show you)
Yeah, make my heart go crazy my love yeah (Wow, wow wow)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of, yeah (Can't get enough of you, baby)
My love is like my drug (My drug), my love is like my drug yeah (My drug)
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of (I can't get enough)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my little genius
We just in a game of hide and seek love
Keep up, on the run, I'ma lead ya (Lead ya), I need ya (Need ya)
You be Rome I'll be Ceasar, what do you dream of (Huh)
Girl you my pre-love, I be stuck, freeze up
Got me nervous, mumblin' my words tell me speak up
Burn this motherfucker down, it'll be fun, earnest
What you wanna learn, I can teach ya
Jesus, we drunk, she down for the threesome
She just, wanna go crazy while she be young
Yeah, and it never get old, give her the world shit
Anything goes (I can't get enough)
