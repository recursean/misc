[Intro]
Let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Hands up, hands up
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
Hands up, hands up
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
Verse two, verse two, here we go

[Verse 2]
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend (Whoa)
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

[Refrain]
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Hands up, London
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
One more time
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
Put your motherfucking hands
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
In the motherfucking air
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

[Outro]
*Applause*
