[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Hello happiness
Hello honeymoon
Hello passionate love, where the fuck was you
I been waiting all my life just for you
Am I in love with you?
Or am I just confused?
Baby, you was the one to come and save me
Tell the word it wasn’t crazy
But lately
Your mind just isn’t here no more
What did I do?
You’re not a bitch just always angry
But it’s so difficult to hate me
I’m the closest thing to home you’ll ever know

[Chorus]
Oh baby why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it’s still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You’re never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Hello for the night
It ain’t complicated
Don’t you worry bout a thing ain’t no obligation
Not a single string attached, this ain’t a puppet show
You didn’t want to fall in love you made it come and go
Yeah she was only here so I forget her
And be distracted by the pleasure
Its way too painful to remember
So I get faded and pretend it’s all good
And when I’m underneath the weather
Trying to keep my shit together
I never
Surrender

[Chorus]
Oh baby why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it’s still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You’re never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
Yeah

[Outro]
