[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh baby I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's getting harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place where the lakes such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it I break it down
Might just break me down

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember I've been keeping it together but I'm feeling strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws they go missing
It's likely they might be but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well I'm just being honest my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turning 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walk and drop in change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity um, I move carelessly that's why I'm always tripping
I guess that's like electrolytes you help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws they go missing
It's likely they might be but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
