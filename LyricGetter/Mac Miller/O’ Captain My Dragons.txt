Yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Back when I didn't know myself (yes, sir)
I thought I needed so much help (yes, sir)
I wasn't yet grown, couldn't do it on my own
"I'mma make it", what I told myself (okay)
Oh, how alone I felt
Now they mouth right below my belt
Tell 'em they can go to hell because this shit just me
Don't need no one else
And my records like phones, they sell
No I'm not done in this ring, better hold that bell
Gimme a break of that Kit-Kat bar
Who that famous bitch in that car?
Everybody run they mouth about somebody
You'd a thought God said "fuck bitches get money"
Can I get an amen and a milk and honey
Shits real how you feel, how you feel, do you love me?
So lets get electric, majestic
Infected with sex and depressants
This fresh shit the best shit's accepted
I've dealt with rejection, the lesson that I've learned
All this hatred I lack concern cause I've waited long enough
It's my turn, now lift that ass up
You want that match up you had to burn
I do the work the universe assignin'
Who's the first [?] carry you, disturbed she don't get peculiar
I was bringin' out juice in the troopeter
Excuse me sir, I don't know who you confuse me for
Cause the raps colder than Jupiter, [?]
Huge berserk, go the distance [?]
God Damn
Pluto's still a planet
Pluto's still a planet if you ask me
Flow is crafty, no one's gonna catch me
Where are my idols? Now they old and saggy
Some of these rappers dontcha know your daddy
Know on baps you'll go and blow an addy
Hoes is laughin' up in the backseat
Shut they asses up [?] taxi
Throw an alley-oop in, all I do is make music
I don't take a break, been four days awake, dedication no bullshit
The sky the limit, we roofless
Don't got time for excuses
Chasin' pussy so stupid
Swear to god I'mma die in this booth, shit

[Hook]
Once a Judist, too Confucius
Once a Judist, too Confucius
Yeah, I'm sick of dodgin' these bullets
And watchin' all of my movements
As a kid was so foolish but I'm no longer a student
I still believe in dragons (fire, dragons)
I still believe in dragons (fire, dragons)
This shit right here is so sacred, I'm never lettin' them take it
Fuck your problems, everyone got 'em
Lets go to space and get faded

[Verse 2]
It's bout time you respect the genius
Bout time everybody pledged allegiance
Thin-skinned rappers have flesh anemic give em homicide
Tell em "rest in pieces"
Imitators emulate TMZ shit
Ride the wave till they gettin' sea sick
In a league that, they can't compete with
Nobody give a fuck who the second team is
Like a broken record all these broken records
I'm immature though, I don't know no better
I'm at home watchin' episodes of Becker with a cup of coco and a polo sweater
I'm only gettin' better breathin' fire
Smokin' on a tenner, keep me higher
My flow [?] temper easy violence
Death before surrender, no survivors

[Hook]
Once a Judist, too Confucius (I'ma get ya)
Once a Judist, too Confucius
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred (Bullets)
I'm never lettin' them take it
Fuck your problems, everyone got em
Lets go to space and get faded
I still believe in dragons (Fire breathing dragons, fire breathing)
I still believe in dragons (Fire breathing dragons, fire breathing)
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred
I'm never lettin' them take it
Fuck your problems, everyone got em
Lets go to space and get faded
I still believe in dragons
(Oh my lord, how do you do it?)
I still believe in dragons
(Aren't you gettin bored? Before this disaster and all this war)
I still believe in dragons
(Where's the light, oh captain my captain)
I still believe in dragons
(I could fly high like them dragons but, there's no such thing as dragons anyway)
