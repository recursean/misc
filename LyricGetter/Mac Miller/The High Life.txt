[Verse]
I'm so high (So high, high)
Find me somewhere in the sky (In the sky, in the sky)
And I know (I know, I know)
These days just flow by (Flow by, flow by)
When you're so high (So high, high)
Headed somewhere in the sky (In the sky, in the sky)
And you know (You know, you know)
These days just flow by (Flow by, flow by)
When you're so high (So high, so high)

[Outro]
Yeah, my name is Mac Miller
And you are now living
The High Life
Most Dope
Big Jerm I see ya!
Get into it
