[Intro]
Oh my (I can't hear anything)
Oh me, oh my
Yeah, muah
I told myself I'd never do cocaine, I told myself I'd never do cocaine
I told myself I'd never do cocaine, I told myself I'd never
Okay, yeah

[Verse 1]
I never leave the house without a rain coat, it's fatal
The eye of the storm is tryna tango (Tango)
When I say "Go," race me to my gravestone (Gravestone)
Welcome to the late show
A true loner, carryin' a bolder on my shoulders like it's nothin'
I'm comin' from deception and seduction
Buggin', hallucinogenic druggin' through customs
Wonderin' what's life without destruction
I'm a functionin' drug user
The feelin' that run through you
You wanna be numb, do you?
Somethin' that fucks you up (Fuck you up)
I told y'all I ain't a role model (Role model)
First you lose your mind, then your soul follows (Soul follows)
Full throttle through the city, dodgin' pot holes
I want no trouble, I'm just tryna find the crossroads
I'm awful, when I die, bury me in fossil
Bury me in polo with a hundred in my nostril (Nostril)
My motto is fuck tomorrow
Only God knows I'm not home
Probably selling drugs inside a Costco
Watch close, optical illusions, they complex with
Don't get tricked, the head trip will turn into a death wish
The high is deceptive
The mind playin' Tetris, follow signs to the exit
Hexes for my exes, I'm savin' them from the wreckage
Confession, all my regrets
I just hope I get into Heaven, I'm gone
Still before death when they told me you are next
Wait until the storm gets gorgeous
Then the Lord said from a '62 Corvette
"I'll see you when I see you," that's a sure bet (Sure bet)
I'll still be here sittin' on my porch steps (Porch steps)
Bumpin' Alanis Morissette
Do it big as Neil Diamond's forehead
I'm havin' more sex than a porn set, sinner
Lights dimmer, I'm a wizard
Hit Pittsburgh for the winter
Get trapped inside a blizzard, damn
It's Larry Fisher, man (Man)
Here he go with this again (Here he go with this again)

[Verse 2]
A new day with the same high (Same high)
Nothin' on the agenda, I'm watchin' paint dry (Paint dry)
It's okay to waste time, go and take five (Take five)
Not in over my head, I'm just waist high (Waist high)
I pray to God I can fall asleep
Sick of these annoyin' talkative sheep
A bunch of hustlin' llamas sellin' me fleece
Hopin' the gyro taste better in Greese (It's pronounced giro)
My dad told me I'm a werido
I told him, "Shut up, I'm a fuckin' superhero"
When I grow up, I hope I'm Robert De Niro
Except Hov would pick the phone up
Worry 'cause I love coke so much
Well, now my nose sucks
I still pour up in the soda
I guess it makes me think I'm Yoda, uh
Hit the red carpet in a toga
Piece of paper and a tie, ticonderoga
I just wanna put my dick in Omarosa
And say she fire unless she make me a mimosa

[Outro]
That shit better be good too, bitch
That shit better be good too, bitch
That shit better get me drunk too, bitch
Better cover that shit with two lips
I ain't talkin' 'bout the flower, I'm talkin' 'bout your mouth
Just give me the power, woo!
This my house, I don't shower, and I wear a blouse
Change every hour
