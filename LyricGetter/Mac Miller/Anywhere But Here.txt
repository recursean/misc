[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well, she got a
Split personality, she wake up half asleep
Walk up to the mirror, ask herself if she gon' have something today
How easily she changed
She wear so many faces, but she wanna stay the same, yeah
And everybody think she playin' games
Yeah, that pretty smile hidin' all her pain

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
No one ever listen when she tryin' to explain
And it's probably the reason for how wild she became

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Okay, now she just wanna be
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
She believes people are free
Far away from here, far away from here

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I remember when I met you, you intimidated me
I tried to get your number, you said, "Only in your dreams"
Okay, so I thought about you when I go to sleep
You never notice me, you was way out of my league
Until you broke your crown, girl, you used to be a queen
What happens now? Life after royalty

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
No one ever listen when she tryin' to explain
And it's probably the reason for how wild she became

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Okay, now she just wanna be
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
She believes people are free
Far away from here, far away from here

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Woman]
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I

[Outro: Paige Montgomery]
Yeah, daddy
Oh yeah, right there
Oh my God!
