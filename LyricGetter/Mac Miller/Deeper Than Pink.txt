Yeah
A love song
In the key of Lex Luger
Deeper than pink

[Verse 1]
I didn't even mean to break your heart
So lemme put it back together
It's funny cause I kinda thought
That this would last forever
I been goin' through the pain
Miss when this was at it's pleasure
"I love you" sounded better then
Now it just repetitive
Sippin' on codeine girl that's my sedative
Cause I can't sleep alone
When you needed me at home
I wasn't there, fighting yelling
You tellin' me nothing is fair
Girl I got a heart of gold
And trust me there's enough to share
Chillin' in your underwear
We gon' do some fuckin' yeah
And after that I'll tell you
How I'm so in love with you
Lay on top your comforter
Fuckin' till the sun come up
Bubble butt, smack you on the ass
After I bust a nut
Don't call you honey
But you sweeter than the candy
After Halloween and Valentines day
Both put together
You never gon' find one better
This love for you, last forever
Incredible, take you to festivals
When you in bed, fixin' your hair
You know that I love it curly
I love it when you wake up in the mornin'
And if it's early we may, fuck a little
Take her ass to sleep
I like what I see, I hope she take a likin' to me

[Hook]
My drink is, deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face
Be like "take that", haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is, deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed
Tell me "face that", haha
But she been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that

[Verse 2]
My drink is, deeper than pink and she hate that
She love to talk to stray cats
Find an address written on their name tag
She innocent but smart as well
Deadly as the harm she felt
She either tell you
All is well or rot in hell
All depends on how you wanna treat her
So I try my best
But, being who I am will have her all upset
And I don't know what I should do
Cause I been born to make these moves
I just hope that I can fix her with a call or text
All unless, it's complex and difficult
Tryna figure out, if it isn't or it is my fault
She keeps to herself
Locked somewhere deep down in the vault
Place I haven't been at all
Where the strong survive and the cripple fall
Here lets talk out in the hall
I just wanna know what's on your mind
Not only cause I love you
But I'm interested to find
What's behind those two eyes
I like what I see, I hope you take a likin' to me
Hey

[Hook]
My drink is, deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face
Be like "take that", haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is, deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed
Tell me "face that", haha
But she been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that
My drink is, deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face
Be like "take that", haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is, deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed
Tell me "face that", haha
But she been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that
