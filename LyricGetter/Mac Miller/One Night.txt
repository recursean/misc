[Chorus]
This our only chance, I gotta' catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night
Baby all I got is one night
I see you dancin’, you love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain't gonna' be the same
It’s just one night, baby all I got is one night

[Verse 1]
I know you got a man of your own
Stayin' at home, while you dance alone
Takin' pics on your camera phone
Internationally known to be bad to the bone
Girl I can take you out of here, of to another whole atmosphere
We can take a trip, no need to make it quick
'Cause we ain't even gotta' come back this year
Now what do we have right here
Baby girl wanna' get nice alright
Don't fight, though it don’t seem right
Are we gonna’ have this tonight, alright
Let's make it somethin’ to remember
Nothin' feel better than a happy ending
I know you want me, and I want you too
So stop pretending

[Chorus]
This our only chance, I gotta' catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night
Baby all I got is one night
I see you dancin', you love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain’t gonna' be the same
It's just one night, baby all I got is one night

[Verse 2]
Girl let's take a trip, make a wish
I bet it all come true
You know wassup with me, I'm tryna' see wassup with you
Just want you for the night, then after that I'll let you loose
Saw all the liqour in the world
So tell your friends to bring their juice
And we can mix it (mix it), chase it (chase it)
Girl that'll like to taste it
Don't got a lot of time, and baby girl, don't wanna' waste it
Come hang with the kid, I'ma make you feel rich
I can tell that you's a freak, by the way you swayin' your hips
So

[Chorus]
This our only chance, I gotta' catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night
Baby all I got is one night
I see you dancin', you love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain't gonna' be the same
It's just one night, baby all I got is one night

[Outro]
One night, one night
One night, one night
