[Intro]
Yeah
God damn
Alright, it goes like
Bitches on the table, bitches on the floor
Bitches in the window, bitches at the door
Bitches in the whip, bitches in the trunk
Bitches doin' blow, bitches rollin' blunts

[Chorus]
Bitches, yeah, bitches
Bitches, motherfuckin', bitches

[Verse 1]
Oh, no, this that motherfuckin' raw, do your job
Y'all trick, y'all motherfuckin', y'all kneel down
I'm a motherfuckin' God when I enter
Boss, I'm the center of attention, nothin' better
And it's all for this head circle, dollar collector
Flow so dope, got 'em lost like a temper
Know a bunch of bitches who all want to be a Jenner
And they suckin' dick tryna network
Crazy ass

[Chorus]
Bitches, yeah, bitches (I ain't tryna be rude)
Bitches, motherfuckin' bitches (Know exactly what you do)
Bitches, yeah, bitches (Everybody know a few)
Bitches, motherfuckin' bitches (Goin' up, gettin' loose)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Here I am with the dick, turn a bitch to a fan now
And she off the pill, pop a xan now
Made wanna give my mom a grandchild
She was doin' drugs till she ran out
Gettin' lit like the fire on the camp ground, yeah
Never give a bitch a hand out
And you see me stand down 'cause I'm comin' for your

[Chorus]
Bitches, yeah, bitches (I ain't tryna be rude)
Bitches, motherfuckin' bitches (Know exactly what you do)
Bitches, yeah, bitches (Everybody know a few)
Bitches, motherfuckin' bitches (Goin' up, gettin' loose)

[Verse 3]
I'm a motherfuckin' instigator, ballistic nature
Bitch get crazy off a sip of Jäger
Tellin' me to infiltrate her
Wanna get intimate with a stranger
Baby, I got dick for acres
Motherfuckin' pussy pleasin' innovator
Pleasure now, I handle business later
Lovin' every single flavour
I'm talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
Bitches, yeah, bitches
Bitches, motherfuckin', bitches
