[Intro]
Turn it up a little bit yeah
First song recorded, in a hotel studio
It got me feeling like I made it and shit, haha

[Verse 1]
She tells me that she don't know who I am
I've changed so much and she don't understand
Got me saying "God damn"
What made me this way?
And I've been thinkin' that it's takin' way too long
Everything I do they think it's wrong
I must move on
What made me this way?

[Chorus]
'Cause everything better when you make a little bread (Bread)
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head (Head)
Kingsize bed in my hotel suite (Suite)
I know I got money every time I go to sleep (Sleep)
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?

[Verse 2]
I see you, I see you, I see you
They watch me as I figure all this out
When they comin' in I tried my best to keep a count
But there's no doubt
That made me this way
And they try
But never will they know the work I do
On my grind all night the moon lights up the room
The dream come true
What made me this way?

[Chorus]
'Cause everything better when you make a little bread (Bread)
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head (Head)
Kingsize bed in my hotel suite (Suite)
I know I got money every time I go to sleep (Sleep)
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?

[Verse 3]
Countin' my money, couple thousand every night
Thinkin' to myself "This can't be life"
Everything I'm seein' this can't be right
They must've poured a little lean in my Sprite
That's alright, that's okay
Fuck tomorrow, we here today
Hey, shit don't change
What the fuck made me this way?

[Chorus]
'Cause everything better when you make a little bread (Bread)
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head (Head)
Kingsize bed in my hotel suite (Suite)
I know I got money every time I go to sleep (Sleep)
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?
