[Verse 1]
Well it's a, crazy motherfucker named Mac
Shit I'm in it too deep, ain't no time for goin' back
And the flow is jacked, colt 45 in the grocery bag
You know it's that explosion rap, fire cracker, broken glass
These motherfuckers ain't bubblin' the soda flat
Forever I'ma go to bat, bitches wanna hold him back
Impulsive, irrational, he a maniac but fuck gossip
Keep it casual, where the paper at
A couple problems, fuck options too late for that
I need the check, someone tell me where the waiter at
Oh it's the Devil, tell me where the Angels at
And tell 'em I want my-I want my-want my baby back
Insane shit my brain probably ain't attached
Don't show your face round here it isn't safe for that
Bitch, I got my heart broke, on lock though
Keep a couple keys out in Longboat

[Verse 2]
Okay, well
Well of assets, deeper than the rap check
They sleepin' on the ether still, I ain't take a nap yet
They all up in my shit like an airport bag check
Well, that shit is tactics, you haven't seen me mad yet
Dalai Lama, motherfucker chill out
Weed was so cool but everybody poppin' pills now
Yup, the broke till I'm dead hoodie on
I make the songs that the bitches throw the pussy on
I'm a king on the board, y'all be lookin' pawn
Pissin' on the lawn with my dick in my palm
Isn't he on, officially the ticker of bombs
At the crib, chillin' thinkin' bout Nicki Minaj
It's a mirage, don't believe half the shit that we say
Me, I'm on the freeway, motherfuckin' PA
Droppin' like D-Day, shoppin' like ebay
Always gotta ball up, I'm Fuamatu-Ma'afala that

[Hook]
Drugs
Yeah, don't, do
