[Intro]
(Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to the sounds of The High Life)

[Chorus 1]
Roll a Swisher up
Put the windows up
I'm in the whip
I'm ridin' high
(I am Mac Miller)
Roll a Swisher up
Put the windows up
Chillin' with your bitch
I'm ridin' high
(So for y'all who don't know, you about to find out real quick)
Roll a Swisher Up
Put the windows up
Gon' hit that spliff
I'm ridin' high
(If you smoking a L better roll ya motherfucking windows up bitch, it's The High Life)

[Verse 1]
Gotta bunch of piff don't touch don't sniff
Y'all gon hit it when the blunt get lit
Weed so loud that it bust through bricks
I'm kidnap Pele trunk gon' kick
It's The High Life come and get ya mind right
I'm in the spotlight, blind cause it shine bright
Let me get a dutchie and a honey wanna love me
Never bummy, getting money, well that's just my night
And when the lights go out, nobody gon' know yo name
Fans screaming they believe him when they meet him
It's so easy and they see that when he blow to fame
See the kid know the game
And I'm a little bit swole at change
But forget that, kick back
Hit that piff sack
Light up show your flame

[Chorus 2]
Roll a Swisher up
Put the windows up
I'm in the whip
I'm ridin' high
Roll a Swisher up
Put the windows up
Chillin' with yo bitch
I'm ridin' (High)
I'm ridin' high
Roll a Swisher up
Put the windows up
Gon' hit that spliff
I'm ridin' (High)

[Outro]
Jerm you crazy for this one!
