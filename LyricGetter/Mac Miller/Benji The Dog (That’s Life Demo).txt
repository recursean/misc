[Sample]
He's never going to stop being the juice

[Verse 1]
Yeah, they told me, "Don't make a promise you can't keep"
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family, man
Man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smoking weed, 'causing trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything, I guess we even now
Nothing better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, "Why the long face?"
How I spent 350 dollars on this entré
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, fine forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton (Haha)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody live a little, everybody die (Yeah, yeah)
That's life (That's life), whatchu gonna do? (Whatchu gonna do?)
That's life (That's life), baby, I would spend it all witchu (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I'm headed to the other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standing ovation?
A hundred naked bitches in my dressing room waiting
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm getting high, making love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feeling fucked over so much
Always coming up short, you like the roach of a blunt (Yeah)
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck paying bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doing wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life (That's life)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody live a little, everybody die (Yeah, yeah)
That's life (That's life), whatchu gonna do? (Whatchu gonna do?)
That's life (That's life), baby, I would spend it all witchu (Yeah)

[Outro]
Say you running out of time
That's life, babe, that's life, babe (Yeah)
Wrong things on your mind
That's life, babe, that's life, babe (Yeah)
Said your heart been broken
That's life, babe, that's life, babe
Just pick it up and keep going
It's alright, babe, it's alright, babe
