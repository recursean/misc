[Intro]
Yeah, one more beat?
Yeah, yeah
I um, woke up early this morning
That's very rare
But, I felt like I haven't slept, in a while
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Forever invincible with the infinite flow
Crackin' the DaVinci code, I play the game on difficult
Could've been the G.O.A.T, but I blew it like a piccolo
My bitch alone in the bed, she feelin' miserable
I got my flaws too, locked inside his dark room
And I ain't no photographer, I'm something like a carpenter
Full of broken promises, I said I'd build a rocket for
Her to fly away in but she'd never come back
Lord knows that she's hard to faze, got a soft spot for her
She agitated in this maze, I am lost for words
You don't need binoculars to see the monikers
Gettin' popular, it feels a bit twisted, word to Oliver
Lyin' pathologically, smile at the comedy
I only sleep with a song playin' on repeat
Tryna do the right thing, I hope to pop your seeds
Girl, lovin' you is all I really need

[Chorus]
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I still remember making out on Jenny's couch
You gave me one more kiss before you let me out
Couldn't spend a day without each other, wouldn't separate
Lost in conversation, having sex could wait a week or two
In my daddy's car, talking 'til the sun came up
You slept at your moms but you text me when you wake up
Quickly came love, the pain led to break ups
You hated it, it made you sick, every time I take drugs
It's all my fault, over-dramatic, always actin' suicidal
You call me on my lies though
If love were a religion, you wrote the Bible
Wanna grow old together and watch the time go
And I would give it all back
Before I lost you again, no, I don't want that
Just wait for me, let me take my time
I'm all yours, baby, rain or shine, yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house (Yeah)

[Outro]
I know the thought of forever is kinda scary
But, baby, we should get married
Give you a baby you can carry
Our love will never be ordinary
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
One more
