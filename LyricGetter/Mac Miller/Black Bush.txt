[Chorus]
Tell me what reality is, all of y'all back on my dick
Whoa, whoa
I don’t get mad about shit, but did you see that ass on that bitch?
Whoa, whoa
No, I’m not waitin' in line, you got a little paper? That’s fine
Whoa, whoa
Find it hard to make up my mind, all of y'all hate when I shine
Whoa, whoa

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
(Ladies and gentlemen
This is a revolution)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
On that black bush, smoke a bunch of Backwoods
My mind numb, I’m high as high come
I’m somewhat of a fuck up, put it in her guts ‘til the cum bust
Combustion, at the function, drunk and actin' as prophets would
When Pac rocked with Suge, smokin' blunts at Hollywood
I was a youngin who didn’t know shit 'bout nothin'
But now I’m 21 and I feel like I’m onto somethin'
Gettin' emphysema, madder than Ebenezer
I’m a king, bitch (Salads, I get a Caesar)
Pullin' uranium from Mesopotamian rivers
I need a bitch that let me fuck and make me some dinner
God made me a sinner, followin' protocol
Overall, I’m fuckin' bitches and there’s coke involved
Watchin' Carl Sagan, wishin' I could talk Jamaican
I’m waitin', be prepared for invasion

[Chorus]
Tell me what reality is, all of y'all back on my dick
Whoa, whoa
I don’t get mad about shit, but did you see that ass on that bitch?
Whoa, whoa (Woo)
No, I’m not waitin' in line, you got a little paper? That’s fine
Whoa, whoa
Find it hard to make up my mind, all of y'all hate when I shine
Whoa, whoa

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I blow a kiss to the Jehovah’s Witness
Fuck a corporation, I support local business (That's the right thing to do)
And this one goes out to all the hoes and bitches
My homies told me, "Better know your limits" (Know your limits)
I’m so efficient, old tradition with dope prevision (Whoa)
We smokin' if we here, homie, don’t need no permission
Variation of avian in the atrium
Waitin' for nature’s rain to shower y'all with some sense
Shit, life gets realer than the press kits
Special like Ed is, so someone call the medic
‘Cause I lost my mind, I’m off the Richter scale (Richter scale)
Don’t you worry yourself, baby, this is hell (Woo)
Product of a witches spell, rappers all Chippendale
I’m gettin'-gettin' money now, expensive ginger ale (Taste good)
Sip the whiskey with a bitch named Lewinsky (Haha)
Told her give me head and tell everybody (Tell everybody, let 'em know)
