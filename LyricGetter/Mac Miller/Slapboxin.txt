[Intro]
Uh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse: 1 Mac Miller]
I came through whippin' somethin' clean like a bald head
Bitch with me drop dead gorgeous, plus she well read
I'ma get brain on the plane if it's overnight
I'ma maintain in the game, I ain't overnight
Colder than some polar ice, or like the ghost on poltergeist
Opinions suck, I know I'm nice, money talks, you overpriced
I'm doper, fuck a sober life, you local, you ain't smokin' right
My weed loud as Hulk Hogan fights when he rip the shirt
On the throne, you kickin' dirt, sip this purp, and spit berzerk
You a bitch, your chick a flirt, stop your crying, get to work
I talk shit, got the stats that'll back it up
My shit adding up, racking up a plaque a month
And that loud ass bass you hearin', that's the trunk
That vibration on your body, now that's a bump
You can tell us who you are, you don't have to front
You ain't a captain, you just Captain Crunch

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rock A-P-C's, some B-A-P-E's
So many different clothing brands, I got A.D.D
Bought a big ole' crib, you can picture me in it
Just decided that the sky isn't really my limit
Somethin' cold in my cup, some weed, rollin' a blunt
Smile long, like I convinced Oprah to fuck
I think I lost my mind, need a Amber Alert
You can't talk that shit unless you stand in it first
Turn a bitch to fan, even hand her some merch
To be a legend, you gotta start out with that amateur work
And I paid my dues, walked humbly on an ego trip
Sleepin' with a freaky bitch, you was chillin', chiefin' fifth
Doin' drugs with a porno chick, watchin' porno flicks
Make her own movie and I'm scorin' it
I'll see you in hell before I see you winnin'
Did it myself, and I beat the system

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
I got thirty thousand grams in a black on black van
Tell Chapo im his number one fan
I'm at Bent Taco with a hunnit' A-bands
And you ain't gettin' no work listenin' to this money change hands
I'm tryna sow the whole block up that's my plan
We can have a gun fight like i walked and i ran
Half a mill on el tran
Sellin' (?) to make bands
Im movin kushy, you's a pussy pussy, come between friends
If my Vo try to book me, I'ma get the front end
Style sixty niggas wit' me with a 100 elf hands
Ice cubes on my wrist
Bitch, I got a Mac-10
I put her out
She got her mom like i let her back in
Its Gucci!

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'

[Outro: Gucci]
Its Gucci
Whats happenin?
Smoke somethin
Po' up
Get you some money
Burr
Haa Squad
Shoutout to my boy Mac man
Its Gucci
You know how we rock
He ain't gettin no money
He don't need nothin'
