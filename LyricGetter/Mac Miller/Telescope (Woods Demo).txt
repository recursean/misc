[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me (Like those before me)
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories (Know the stories)
And you need to let me know
When you leave and where you go
Can I come? (Can I come?)
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't, that'll get you sprung (That'll get you sprung)

[Chorus 1]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away love, hate love
Heart break will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I'll put your face in the place where the space was
Nobody make you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just looking for someone to make you move
Ooh, tell me (Do I?)

[Chorus 2]
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken (So close to broken)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, it's all I got (It's all I got)
Yeah, put it together, then it break
All the energy it take
It never stop (Never stop)

[Chorus 1]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I try to tell you 'bout a better life, you get involved
Big or small, it's been my fault
I keep you safe, it's in the vault
Blind folded keep it going 'til we hit a wall
Yeah, I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up (Go up), we can only go up (Go up)

[Chorus 2]
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken (So close to broken)

[Chorus 1]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?
