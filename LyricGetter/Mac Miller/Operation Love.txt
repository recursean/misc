[Intro]
Operation failure to launch

[Verse 1]
Operation failure to launch
Good vibrations, take what you want
Patiently wait where you are
I'm coming, I'm running to you for eternity
Doctor, fix me up— I need awakened
Her eyes are closed, my dreams are vacant
Plans we made, they must go on
Don't be afraid, I won't be long

[Chorus]
My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't make me drown
Into the clouds I'll find my home
When I'm with her I'm not alone

[Bridge]
Occupation love, ohh uhh ohh uhh uh oh
(Oh!)
Occupation love, ohh uhh uh, ohh uhh uh oh

[Verse 2]
Standing ovation, pledge to this nation
Dream of creation, what are we waiting for?
(Yeah) Time wasting
Reality with a few modifications, God behind Satan
I musta, musta saw faces
Hell's gonna come before it changes (we)
Obligated to tolerate the evil
Planet over-populated by the people but I see you
When you're disguised, you be keepin' it live
But I got you where I want you, I be deep in your mind
(Yeah)
Love is among us and I'm seeing the signs
You too strong to move on and leave me behind (yeah)
I love you, girl— you know that
I found peace inside you and I don't wanna go back

[Chorus]
My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't make me drown
Into the clouds I'll find my home
When I'm with her I'm not alone

[Bridge]
Occupation love, ohh uhh, ohh uhh uh oh
(Oh!)
Occupation love, ohh uhh, ohh uhh uh oh
