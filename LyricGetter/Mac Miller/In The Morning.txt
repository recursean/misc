[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Um, she say she love me for these cold ass raps
Wanna be involved but no strings attached
Listen, honey, I’m feelin' kinda hungry
Go to dinner with ya girls, can you bring somethin' back?
It’s unusual that I would feel so strong
The party upstairs, you waitin' in the lobby
Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early
Just keep it wet and I'll hit it in the morning
Glory, free-fallin' 43 stories, cordially sippin' 40s
Hooked up to morphine, for sure clean like bald heads
I kinda wish that we would fuck more and talk less
Except me and you a little far-fetched
Reach for the stars, got my arms stretched, God bless

[Chorus: Syd & Thundercat]
I can feel it tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can feel it tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And I, I need a cool bitch, conversation skills
Roll blunts and in love with Darth Vader films
Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
When it turn to fall, she love to go and rake the leaves
Make believe, used to dream of bein' Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stash
She up late, worry, tell me hurry up home
11 missed calls on my phone, whoa

[Chorus: Syd & Thundercat]
I can feel it tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can feel it tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning

[Instrumental: Thundercat]
