[Intro]
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 1]
Well, hello, good evenin'
I'm with you long as I'm breathin'
For every season, my girl, she keep on keepin' me decent
I'm workin', not takin' weekends
I barely got time for sleepin'
Searchin' for meanin', fiendin' for freakiness
How it's bein', shit
I been the coldest, since winter solstice, mmm
I had a soul, I know that shit is frozen, mmm
Out of control, I am a livin' moment, mmm
I got that dopamine, know if you want it, yeah
Feel like I'm runnin' out of time, a couple days behind
This shit that's runnin' through my mind
There ain't no way I'm fine
And maybe I'm just wastin' time
Sick of playin' games, get out my gymnasium
I am a collector, of money and pressure
There's nobody better, out of my skull, I'm Hannibal Lecter
Yes sir, killin' all the noise
You know how it go; first you build it, then destroy

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me (I can be my own me, own me)
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only (Only)
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need (Got what you need)
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah (That's how it be)
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Okay, scatter brain, scatter brain
On my own island, I'm a castaway, who rackin' up these accolades?
You already know, so I don't have to say
I'm comin' up with words just like a motherfuckin' Scrabble game
Don't put out my wildfire (Wild), wildfire (Wild)
Take me up a mile higher, a mile higher (Mile)
Talkin' shit, we outside, we outside
I'm makin' motherfuckin' classics in my downtime (Yeah)
I'm a giant, how the fuck you talkin' down to me?
This that shit that make a hater raise up out they seat
And I can't see you from my balcony
I'm in the clouds and you lookin' like the ground to me
Yeah, told 'em already, I tell 'em again
I'ma keep killin', I'm livin' until I'm a hundred and ten (Woo)
Yeah, invincible, this shit is never gon' end
So tell a friend to tell a friend
Who tell a friend, who tell a friend

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me (I can be my own me, own me)
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only (Only) (Woo)
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need (Got what you need)
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah (That's how it be)
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only
