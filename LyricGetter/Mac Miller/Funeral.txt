"I know what happens to you, me and everyone else
When they supposedly die
It's this passage around the great loop"

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, can you turn up my headphones?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This music go with my funeral, yeah, yeah
Music go with my funeral, a-hem, yeah, I said

[Verse 1]
Said I was raised inside this gritty city, ridin' through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All these sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me
Doin' drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty, but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm tourin'
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassin' me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't gettin' back to me
A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just tryna get some peace of mind, yeah
I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

[Chorus]
This the last (last) day (day)
Of my life (of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (last) day (day)
Of your life (of your life, of your life, of your life)
This the motherfucking last (last) day (day)
Of my life (of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (last) day (day)
Of your life (of your life, of your life, of your life)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
See we swallowed in this web of lies, never tried to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never died, oh this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Starin' inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smokin' on this field of hope, waitin' 'til my deal gets closed
I keep gettin' hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
22 don't feel so old, but I think I'm 82
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, makin' danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searchin' for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth then what the fuck am I?
Yeah

[Chorus]
This the last (last) day (day)
Of my life (of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (last) day (day)
Of your life (of your life, of your life, of your life)
This the motherfucking last (last) day (day)
Of my life (of my life, of my life, of my life)
Party like it's the last (last) day (day)
Of your life (of your life, of your life, of your life)

[Outro]
So where are you going?
Where are you headed?
Where are you going?
Can I come? Can I come?
