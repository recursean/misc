[Verse 1]
24/4, now i say things are lookin' up, but I could be drunk
I’m just, gone tomorrow, I'm on time
If you get busy that's fine, just don’t get stuck. (uh)
And fall, and fall, watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Like a brand new summer rain

[Verse 2]
(Uh) Lovin' that you’re takin' it's toll, tell you everything that I know
But it don’t mean much, when you’re in a rush
Just, thinking of taking it slow
We can never paint this house till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Now watch it go down, down, down, down
Like a brand new summer rain
