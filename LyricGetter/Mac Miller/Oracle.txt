[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in a car full of bitches
Makin' art with them, screamin' carpe diem
This is motha fuckin' freedom ain't it?
I came to free the nation
Do the macerana with a waitress at the Applebee's
Who'd rather be a cheetah and—
One day I'mma be the greatest, retire my jersey
I'm the people's favorite
Y2K and Nelly— Dream Land, Kirby
Have 'em bow down, how the ground sound? Dirty
I'm way beyond okay— these hoes ain't
Worthy of the nut-bust
Up-chuck flows when I'm fucked up
You want a war?
Bitch, I'm Chuck Norris with the nunchucks
Lord of all this funk stuff, something like a oracle
I gotchu, it's kung-fu Keanu I'm the one— what?
Droppin' like dump trucks, made it through the sadness
What does everybody run from?
You marchin' through the madness
I'mma kidnap the rap game, hold the bitch captive
Full of so much regret, I should of been a Catholic
Jewish, Buda, Baptist— cooler than a cactus
You sleepin' on my shit then I'mma dookie on your mattress
Whoa— and that smell like roses
Just got myself back
Run and tell that, homie

[Chorus]
It's only me, myself, and I
That's all I need though
Dreamed I would teach myself to fly
It was just a dream though
When I am all alone, I close my eyes
Turn on the music, blow my mind
Whoa oh ohhh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay
And in my mind I'm enormous
Like a giant rhino-saurus or a dinosaur of violent forces
Eyes in the sky, can't find the floor
I'm kinda sorta (crazy)
The medication got me feelin' all (wavy)
Yeah, I'm chasin' paper like I'm broke
Never cater to these hoes
The creator of this dope shit
Got my own chef, plus a waiter and a hostess
Hot as the equator but I'm rarer than the solstice
Don't trip
Breathe of fresh air if you want it
They always staring at me kinda like they seen a ghost
Knock 'em out, T-K-O
Gettin' money is the motive and the pussy just a bonus
Flows is explosive, make a girl sweat like aerobics
Yoga, fucking king cobra, boa
Constrict no bitch, don't even know her
Belushi in a toga, house full of animals
Jedi, yoda—
Everybody wanna grow up and be Hova
I'd rather be Darwin, Clark Kent
New G-Wagon with the dark tint
Came a long way from selling dubs by the park bench
Now we can celebrate, I want this shit forever mane

[Chorus]
It's only me, myself, and I
That's all I need though
Dreamed I would teach myself to fly
It was just a dream though
When I am all alone, I close my eyes
Turn on the music, blow my mind
Whoa oh ohhh

[Outro]
The music, I can fix you with the music
Do you feel this in the music?
People need to hear the music, the music
The music, I can fix you with the music
Do you feel this in the music?
The people need to hear the music, the music
