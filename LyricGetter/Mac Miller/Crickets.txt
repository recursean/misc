[Verse 1]
Oh yeah the God back, had to hit before they made contact
Alright bro, fuckin' with a psycho you should stop that
Fuck rap, wall of plaques stats and you mall shocked
Undeniable for that four foot, that's a long shot
We on top, this a job and everyday is nonstop
Been a boss, call shots, they prayin' I'ma fall off
(I don't need motherfuckers)
Just an interview, all talk, fatality I'ma finish you, bomb drop
And bitches love the kid, I make her nervous
Got her, stu-stu-stutterin', all I do is fuckin' win
Issa giant, can I fuck your shit up cause I'm wildin'
That one is a motherfuckin' bride
Better quiet down, I'm standin' on the high ground
In the music world, wide renowned
I'm makin' money will I'm lyin' down
All these motherfuckers silent now

[Hook]
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets

[Verse 2]
Yeah
And I piss art, comin' for whoever play me in charge
Fit inside your wallet, like a motherfuckin' gift card
Everybody wanna ball and be a big star
It's interception, pick six, play the guitar
Do you wanna be the man, you could be a big shot
All you need is a plan and a little bit of dedication
I went away and kept 'em waitin', now it's back to record breakin'
Yeah, it only matters if it sounds good
When it come to paper, I'ma count books
Hearin' crickets, movin' units, sellin' tickets, fuck the critics
Made it way beyond my fifteen minutes, I'm on
And I'ma put in work when I'm gone
Who'd of thought, millionaire off of makin' some songs
Cold motherfucker you could feel snow
Run your mouth, I don't hear you though

[Hook]
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
