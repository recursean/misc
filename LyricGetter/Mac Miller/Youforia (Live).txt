[Intro]
Alright, look
There’s a song on my album
Called youforia
And
And ima do that

I’m not as a good of a singer as Tay is
But... you know I like to do it

[Verse]
Said, said, said
I been waiting so long
To have you by my side
And I, I can't do no wrong
With you by my side

[Chorus]
Euphoria
Euphoria

[Verse]
And when you, you lay in my arms
The pain goes away
Baby you, you feel so damn good
Just come take my hand
And we could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we land

[Chorus]
Euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria

[Verse]
And when you, you look in my eyes
The pain goes away

[Chorus]
Euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Euphoria

[Outro]
And when you're mine
I won't let you go
No, the pain, it can't stay
Euphoria

[Ending]
Thank you
Thank you everybody
Los Angeles California thank you!
