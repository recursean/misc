[Intro]
When I was a kid, back in kindergarten
That's when I was a kid, you know? What does it mean?
Yeah, yeah, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeah, um do youâ€“
Yeah, damn

[Verse 1]
We been doin' this since you was still in diapers
Keep it movin' like the wipers, cameras shoot us like a sniper
I had dreams of fuckin' me an R&B bitch
I am the melody, who's tellin' me where harmony is?
It's all been a trip like dollars that I drop on my whip
I keep a girl, but when I'm with my friends, I call her my bitch
Asshole, I'ma need an evolution, just illusion
I'm out in space, there's no one left but Houston
I'm at the studio, I'll prolly take some acid after, but
Right now, me, Evan Adams watchin' battle rappers
Filet with every flow, you more like kale, bruh
Illest since I've been in it, don't know what else I can tell ya
And I don't watch TV shows no more
'Cause I got too much on my plate, I'm never home no more
I'm smokin' cigarettes, they fuckin' up my vocal cords
(Alright, after that)

[Chorus]
I like me 'xactly how I is, yeah
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is

[Verse 2]
And I'm in a, I been the hardest since kindergarten kickball
Feelin' such a drug and I've been goin' through the withdrawl
I'm involved with shit that'd kill y'all if you would try it
They worry about my crazy ass, but nah, I'm just a riot
Flow is ultraviolet, I alter minds up when I open up
Cold as fuck, literally stuck in bed, pneumonia
I'm Obi-Wan Kinobi, bruh, surroundin' sound like Dolby does
Fisherman, slangin' bitches dick, I got the Moby plug
Some is built to last, some is built to crumble
And I ain't sayin' I ain't lyin' in the jungle
I'm in Tribeca chillin', feelin' like the daily double
Who you playin' with? I came for trouble
And I send my bitch runnin' to the store real quick
Told her bring me somethin' good, none of that healthy shit
Who else you know that's out here raisin' hell like Lyft?
I can only be myself, that's it

[Chorus]
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
