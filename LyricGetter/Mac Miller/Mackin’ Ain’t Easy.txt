[Intro: from Taxi Driver]
Listen you fuckers, you screw-heads
Here is a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is a man who stood up
Here is—

Easy Mac, yo
Yeeah!

[Verse 1]
I start wars like Star Wars, I'm the emperor
Waiting with patience in this nation, I'm the predator
And if you hating you'll get served with some metaphors
You in the cypher spittin' shit that you've said before
Your shits regular, I've heard it before
I murder it raw
When it switch it droppin' ya jaw
I'm never stoppin'
I got more options than the quarterback
I'm more than that
I'm dedicated, you just sorta rap
A gram of haze for 25, that's a quarter sack
I gotchu on the half, if you wanna order that
Yeah and it'll cost ya, I'm not a slave
But you can shop and save if you cop an eighth
Watch the block for cops, cops coppin' dro
Call 'em corrupt but they (pigs) got a lotta dough
You're monotone, you're actin' like its hard to flow
Homie, you're at fourth down with forty yards to go
I'm a junior but I rap like a veteran
Get more cheddar than anybody that I'm better than
Lemme tell you I spit the shredder
Its sure guaranteed to put the marks in ya sweater

[Chorus]
Easy Mac but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be

[Verse 2]
Cats before ass 'cause I'm out to get rich
Bitches surrounded my dick, I'm countin' my chips
Without it I slip, trip over the foot that they kick
Ain't got cheese for the trees, then don't look at my brick (nope)
The industries infantry, penalties in vanity
The enemy up in the streets, secondaries up in the beef
Chemically I break you down, shots then I take the town
Funeral, I fake the frown
Lay you down and take the crown
Had to take a stand against his castle made in sand
Win the battle with the man, taken apples from a dam
Had to bomb Babylon, the weed you needs in catalog
If you were cream, I had it wrong
Who gives a shits about his mom?
Kickin' competition with the limited edition
And my ambition is I have the proper composition
I deserve the recognition, I'm amazing— definition
Puttin' victims in submission, spittin' each and every sentence (yup)
Too hot like the pot up in ya kitchen
And if you quitcha bitchin' the bitches'll stop snitchin'
I spit it ill, sick like raw chicken
But I'm finger lickin' freestyle king, watch me kill a written

[Chorus]
Easy Mac but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be, it's easy

[Outro]
Chyeah!
Easy Mac, homie
(Yeaaaaaaah)
Put ya blunts out, song's over
Pittsburgh, Point Breeze
Shoutout to my man Sweet James, D-Wreck, BJ, P-Doom, Sammy Slick, B-Dubb, the whole crew, homie
You know where you at
