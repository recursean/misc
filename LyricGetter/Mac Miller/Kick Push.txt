[Intro]
Yeah, we some masters in this man!

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, the rap master
Baggies are past her
Rap faster and crack tracks like they plaster
Lyrically [?], I'm leavin’ Mike [?]
Past is [?], onto the last chapter
Yeah, I lay back and chill
My day's wack but still save rap and ill
You think it's wack, then why ain’t you battlin' it?
I spit people like am I imaginin' this?

[Verse 2: B.DuBB]
Yo, it seems you always on some average spit
Just some average kids, this is hazardous wit'
And as a matter of fact, you'll be mad of this shit
Quick hits, roll them blunts, they be fat as ya chick
Yeah, me and Mac we was born to win it
Sendin' y'all to [?] rap, sleepy, torn, and finished
Your whole frame fucked up and your form diminished
Passin' raps back and forth, like a ball in tennis

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, call me a chemist ’cause I stay in the lab
The only tool in the school is a pen and a ’pad
And Chemistry class, whoa, that's a lil’ bit irrelevant
Writin' rhymes through the class, boostin' my intelligence

[Verse 4: B.DuBB]
Yo, I got a fetish for the fettuccine
[?]
Elders are gettin' jealous, they [?] fellow man

[Verse 5: Mac Miller]
My kingdom is the limit, and my prison and I’m sick of it
It's Malcolm that in the Middle kid, and yes I'm sizzlin'
The kid that gets you the Dro, purp, but get him the dough first
Sit back, relax, and do my homework

[Verse 6: B.DuBB]
Yo, and you ain't better than the test of teachers
We the best, and we dressed in the freshest sneakers
Ill kids, yeah we still rip the best of pieces
And kill these haters for they aters 'cause the stress we eat us
'Cause they be bitin' us, excitin' and repeat us
Tryna wear the same pair of Nikes and Adidas

[Verse 7: Mac Miller]
It's a fact, copy-cats can't copy you
I play these cats, fill they cash like the lottery
This rap shit that's a part of me
Why you tryna come up in my sight but tryna fight the kid that's [?]
If Easy Mac's who you wanna be, then why you wanna crawl up all on top of me?

[Verse 8: B.DuBB]
Yo, I fill 'em up in a tight space like sodomy
Peoples be usin' their brothers like a commodity
The world's a lot colder than I thought it be
Held my ground as a child, but now I'm a prodigy
And you can blame it on the rap [?]
I been wanting to make tapes since I was eight
Now I hussle and I make paper off of eights
I want everyone crumb of the cake that's on the plate, ayy

[Verse 9: Mac Miller]
Kick Push as I set sail
Those aren't clouds in the sky, that's my exhale
Save the hate for the fakes and the bathin' apes
'Cause we gon' roll by high at the shady skates

[Verse 10: B.DuBB]
Yo, Easy Mac gettin' back on some skate shit
Everytime we rappin' on a track, we gettin' Ape shit
Face it, simple and plain, you gain basic
High up in the sky like a spaceship, spacious

[Verse 11: Mac Miller]
Gimme couple words I can play wit'
Guarantee you wanna replay it, stay sit
You can't hate it, damn, we stay famous
Smoke a blunt to myself and I call it a facelift

[Verse 12: B.DuBB]
These haters hatin' so strong I can taste it
Makin' many claims but the game so basic
Y'all [?] wanna hang on the same shit
Grow the fuck up, I won't pay no patience
So time better spent, my mind's on my money
Been on grind ever since [?]
If cops come around, they gon' find evidence
They start tappin' phones, I'ma lie in the trench
Lay the fuck low, lay the fuck low
Stay the fuck home
A hundred Gs [?]
They runnin' up in cribs, tryna take the cash
See I would [?] father home, be the stay for stack
The bacon hates with they races stashed
White boy, drivin' through, while he makes it past

[Verse 13: Mac Miller]
Yeah, we ride by as I chug up the juice
Corrupt cops, tellin' lies, fuckin' up the truth
Scratchin' the surface cops askin what the purpose is
Well, officer, we ain't in need of your services
I got the weed, no seeds, yeah the purple shit
Clown and fools like a circuses, you heard of it
[?] with the weapons of war
Sharp flows, and they hit you like you stabbin' the swords
I'm the mega, the lord, the legend still livin'
Reachin' heavin' still sinnin' the ill-written is still hittin'

[Verse 14: B.DuBB]
Still sittin' on [?]
Bumpin' through your eardrums, fuck up your earlow
Yeah yo, plus I have to be [?]
So I'm takin' everything you got, I ain't askin' for shit

[Verse 15: Mac Miller]
Yeah, me and B-D and in the castle we sit
We just kick back, relax and battlin' kids
Grab your seat belt and please start fastenin' it
Takin' you on some rides, we [?] than this
I propose, that's hoes, to those who came close
And those who oppose, floatin' the same [?]
Gooder than good, and better than most
We just chill, hit kush, kick push and then we coast

[Outro: Mac Miller]
We kick, push, kick push, kick push, kick push and coast
And that's the way we roll so if you rollin' up the blunt I can pack up a bowl
Then we can hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, hit kush and float
And the way we go, yo, y'all hoes couldn't fame me though
So we kick, push, kick push, kick push, kick push and coast
And that's the way we roll so if you rollin' up the blunt I can pack up a bowl
Then we can hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, hit kush and float
And the way we go, yo, y'all hoes couldn't fame me though
And we kick, push, kick push, kick push, kick push and coast
And that's the way we roll so if you rollin' up the blunt I can pack up a bowl
