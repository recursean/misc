[Intro]
Oh shit
Okay

[Verse 1]
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Think it's time for a revolution, me and my dogs 'bout to start a riot
Still they sleeping but I'm eating, you and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement, 'telligent but we going stupid
This the new shit, hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis, bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music, get this money, share the profits
Now this class gettin' led by students, smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground, they didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money, I'm hunting it down, planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight, I just thought you should know

[Refrain]
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the—said

[Chorus]
That girl beautiful, can you introduce me?
She ain't your girl tonight, that bitch a groupie
Some money in the building, better give it to me
I see you starin' at me like you in the movies
Now you watching movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Said, lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my, okay, here we go

[Verse 2]
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Fuck a day job, fuck a day job, got ya bitch here in just a tank top
Getting paid, roll my face off, bitch you're bank fraud: Bernie Madoff
Educate y'all then erase y'all, LL Cool J without the Kangol
I don't see the need to stunt, wish you the best, I'ma just light up this blunt
This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah, I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, thats a lot of bookings
My bitches gorgeous looking, imported from the shore to Brooklyn
Coming from out of the 'Burgh, bitch, I'm absurd, fuck you, I hope you insured
Hating? I'll give you just what you deserve, that's my word, put it on all that I'm worth

[Refrain]
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the show, said

[Chorus]
That girl beautiful, somebody introduce me
She ain't your girl tonight, nah, that bitch a groupie
There's some money in the building, better give it...
Fuck that, you watchin' movies
Said, now you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies

[Bridge]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait [?] what were you playin' there?
Oh, that's [?]... I don't know...
I know the song's supposed to be... song's supposed to be over, but
Fuck that, said, now you watchin' movies

[Chorus (Condensed)]
Said, now you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
