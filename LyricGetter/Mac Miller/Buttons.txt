[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah, alright
Days get mixed up (Uh-huh), schedules get switched up (Uh-huh)
Can't be two places at once (Yep), so
I take a hit of the spliff that I lit up and
Forget I had to be anywhere at all, goddamn
How the mighty will fall (Fall), they wanna see me gone
But I'm here in spite of it all (All), I never play along
You can keep the fear and self-pity (Fear)
I'd rather tell you who I am really, yeah
This is not the wake-up call
I am the hotel operator, I don't owe nobody favors
I don't know how the fuck I've been around so long
Busy as a escalator in a crowded mall (Uh-huh)
It's like, every year I realize my house too small
Get paid, upgrade, two cribs, new maids, more flights, flew planes
Live out my suitcase (Suitcase), lose days like loose change (Loose change)
I swear my life is on Blu-ray
Welcome to doomsday, the world needs a hero
And I am your Bruce Wayne, kind of like Luke Cage, well
(Well, well, well, well) You keep on runnin'
We keep on pushin' your buttons

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright

[Verse 2]
I run around with open scissors (Yeah), they takin' pictures
I could lose my head, it grow instead, gets only bigger
I put one foot in front of the other, I never settle
Waste yo' time with water and wine, I'm turnin' liquid to metals
Still the (Still the,) same dude that used to never be sure (Yeah)
When I was way more insecure, did not feel better before, no
Umbrellas never could weather the storm
No sympathy for the devil, too busy buildin' a temple
I am lookin' beyond (Beyond), leavin' 'em lookin'
Hot as the grill I'm puttin' 'em on when I be cookin'
(Cooking, cooking, cooking)
I keep on runnin' if I have to
Medusa never turned me to a statue, no
I keep it movin' (Movin'), but keep it low (Low)
You can do your thing, shit, to each their own (Yep, yep, yep)
But you better do somethin'
We keep on pushin' your buttons

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright
