[Chorus]
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
That ecstasy

[Verse]
Who put those flowers
Inside of your hair?
Just give me a moment
I'll be right there
You're glowing, those colors
Those colors, you wear
Run through the world
With no care, if you dare

[Chorus]
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Why, a pill
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me that ecstasy
Ooh, ecstasy
