Yeah, ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
On Fourth Street, the orphan children play on the jungle gym
Little Timmy broke his arm again on the monkey bars
Johnny's dad got a nicer car than all the other kids
He becomes the alpha and picks on everybody else
Max protects Claire from all the bullies
Claire always wish she was as pretty as Julie
The boys always chase Julie around the sandbox
Claire just waits ’til she gets picked up by her grandpa
All of this before the brainwash starts
Before they get polluted, start thinkin' like adults
Life is fantasy and somersaults then
Before the world tear apart imagination
Before there were rules, before there were limits
Your only enemies were (Want some Brussels sprouts and spinach?)
Me, I used to want to be a wizard, when did life get so serious?
Whatever happened to apple juice and cartwheels?
Whatever happened to apple juice and cartwheels?

[Outro]
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra (Hahahaha)
Abracadabra, vadacadous
