[Verse 1]
Do you fear, that you'll have no control?
You walk through this world with your head above water
Shoes made of copper, just trying to float
The lakes frozen over, look down at yourself
What's there and back doesn't please you
The man don't believe you ceased to all the lies that you tell
Cards in your hand, you're looking at nothing
You wonder when God will just listen and give you a break
And he says, "See, living and dying are one in the same"

[Chorus]
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?

[Verse 2]
Do you know anything at all?
You've been waiting for answers as parades and dancers keep building your castle so strong
The moon made of water, you swim to the shore
You can try your best escape and the universe is breaking, you say you can't take it no more
The pressure is building like buildings you dreamt for
Wishing that wishing could lift this conundrum
The streets that you walk on are shallow
But do you feel as big as your shadow?

[Bridge]
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No-oh-oh, oh-oh
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No, no, no, no-oh

[Chorus]
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?

[Verse 3]
Said "If you could make-, if you could make-, if you could make-, if you could make-, if you could make-"
If you could make-, if you could make-, if you could make, it go away
Gave you chances, don't fold over

[Instrumental Break]
