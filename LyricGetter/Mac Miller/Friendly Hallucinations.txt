[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers of an innocent, ignorant child (child)
In the ocean, get to swimmin' or drown (drown)
How long has it been since you smiled (smiled)
Girl, I love the way your body fit inside that gown (gown)
Her mama was a lady bug, her papa was an atheist
Workin' on a novel set in Cold War Romania (Romania)
Chasin' love, idolizin' Joan of Arcadia
Pray the landscapers don't wake her up (her up)
I'ma slave to the bass line
Conversation topic got us tangled in the grape vine
Still wide awake I'm, a stranger to the daytime
Vampire, higher than a hang glider
Look around and all I see is great skies (all I see it great skies)
There's help inside that medicine cabinet (cabinet)
Came in for the answers but she left with a habit (habit)
There's no one on the other end of that telephone (telephone)
Lets fall asleep to the metronome, yeah (to the metronome)

[Chorus: Mac & SZA]
She's fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination, yeah
Baby don't let them, tell you what's real and what's not
There's a mirror that's waitin' on the other side of the dock, woah
It's only real if it's real to you
Does it feel?
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
Is it real, said what's it feel like?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Tell me is it real if you can't hold it in your arms
But it can touch you
Feel this texture pressin' up against your chest
You say "I love you", you don't hear it back
Fallin' victim to a world that's filled with satire
Mark Twain admired
Open Tom Sawyer read a passage to a cab driver
She only in the back seat of a taxi 'cause her car is in the shop
With a flat tire
Mom says she believe her but she always been a bad liar
Had a plan to burn her past but it back fired
Hold on and be strong, kneel before your king
The land you put your knees on
It won't be long 'til your path finds you
And if love is just a fantasy
Then what's the problem if you fall in love with fantasy?
They assume she's confused with delusions she's creatin'
In the waitin' room, for psychiatric evaluation
She doesn't have to pay just to be treated like a patient
It'll be okay, if she just swallow this pill

[Chorus: Mac & SZA]
She's fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination, yeah
Baby don't let them, tell you what's real and what's not
There's a mirror that's waitin' on the other side of the dock, woah
It's only real if it's real to you
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
(yes, yes, y'all)

[Bridge: Mac & SZA]
Havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
I'll be havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
They don't need no explanation, there is beauty in creation
My Lord
Havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
I'll be havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
They don't need no explanation, there is beauty in creation
My Lord
(My Lord)

[Outro: Mac & SZA]
Fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination, yeah
Baby don't let them, tell you what's real and what's not
There's a paradise waitin' on the other side of the dock, woah
It's only real if it's real to you
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
