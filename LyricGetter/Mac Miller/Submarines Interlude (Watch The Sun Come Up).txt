[Verse 1]
Slow down before everything change
Twenty-four seven now I say
Things are lookin' up, but I could be drunk
I just, hold onto my arm one time
If you get dizzy that's fine
Just don't get stuck and fall
And fall, watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Like a brand new submarine

[Verse 2]
Lovin’ you is taking it’s toll
Tell you everything that I know
But it don’t mean much
When we’re in a rush
Just, thinking of taking it slow
We can never [?]
Til’ the sun come up
And watch the sun come up
Now watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Brand new submarine
