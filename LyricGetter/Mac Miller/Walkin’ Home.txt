[Intro]
Yeah
It's not official news here, as far as I'm concerned it didn't happen, you shut your mouth
One time
What are you afraid of, because the people might find out?
Two times
This news if not official, you were never under the assumption, it's perfectly clear
Three times
I said it was none of your God damn business
One time, tw-two times two, there's two times two twos, three
Three times, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, um yeah

[Verse 1]
Raps millenniums
Ain't no use tellin' them my plans for the rebellion(No)
The music got me innovator, power no generator
It's the same me, just a couple new developments(It's me)

[Bridge]
They sellin' us our dreams
And we couldn't buy them back if they were sellin' them for free(Cha-ching)
I speak for the diseased and the misunderstood
I left the 'burg for a minute, but it's still all good(Still all good)

[Verse 2]
I push the Beamer and the Benz about to cop the Bentley(Bentley)
Fuck your feelings and your friends you will not correct me(No)
I do this shit correctly, leave a murder scene messy
Dancin' with two lefties screamin' fucking Elvis Presley(Okay)
What do you do when you want to get high
So you call up your connect
Your connect tell you he's dry
It's time to quarantine thinkin' you for sure a fiend
Now your pleasant dreams start to morph into a horror scene(No)
I take morphine and drink chlorine(Uhuh)
Hit the zoo see the lion cage and have an orgy
Drink WD-40, tell a bunch of stories about the make-believe glory(Uuhhhhh)

[Verse 3]
It's that back ally bum fight
Make sure you sittin' up right
Aristocratic pussy ring her bell then she cum twice
I never read the horoscopes
I go to see the oracle
For fortunes, I ignore her though(let's go)
Just a couple words from my mortal soul(Mortal soul)
Time travel, tryin' to get back
But the portal closed(Portal closed)
All-terrain game, bitch, I'm durable(Yeah)
Mister, drifter everythin' is portable(Let's go)
I'm playin' Dominos with the common folk(Hello)
Lose a hundred dollars quickly
Guess that's all she wrote(Hello)
And everybody got their pot of gold(Uhuh)
Even if it's just a loose fifty in the laundry load(God damn)
Start to understand, we are not alone(Nope)
Try to figure out the difference between frogs and toads(Ribbit)
Shit gets real then you got to go(Okay)
It's a rocky road when you walkin' home

[Outro]
Yeah
You walkin' home, I'm walkin' home
Just a couple thoughts as I'm walkin' home
Lookin' at my feet as I'm walkin' home
Lookin' at the street as I'm walkin' home
Thinkin' of my dreams as I'm walkin' home
Be safe when you walkin' home
When you walkin' home, I'm walkin' home
