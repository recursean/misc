[Intro]
Yeah
Let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let
Let, let, let, let, let, let
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let, let, let, let, let's get started
Nobody wanna be themselves, everyone's an artist
Walk around with a target on my head, take your best shot
Watch me do my thing, try and shoot me from the press box
We keep on goin' 'til they press stop
Errr-Errr, I'm breakin' records, so rewind
I left you scared, say a prayer, put it on the Holy Bible
Better hold a microphone like how a soldier hold a rifle
It's the Young Mac, I been there and done that
Went away, then come back with a motherfuckin' vengeance
I'm collectin', every sentence is impressive, learnin' lessons from the legends
Dreams is nightmares, so I fall asleep holdin' a weapon
Some people do this for attention
You can miss me with the bullshit, I gets busy with this music
Tell 'em, "Shut up," or "Get butt-fucked with a broomstick"
Been tourin' since before you were born, and I made the rules, bitch
Thou shalt not hold thy tongue
Don't quit, no goin' home until you done
Like train tracks or breakin' glass, you can hear me comin'
Motherfuckers better take off runnin'

[Chorus]
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Well, it's a speed racer, cross-over knee breaker
Green maker, creator, hotter than the lines on the equator
Take your life and remake ya, all for the green paper
Write it all down but never got the time for eraser
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' song though
Drummin' on some big ol' titties, I'm playin' bongos
I put my long pole in the wrong hole
She say, "Get up out my stomach," I'm like, "Bitch, you know you love it"
I'm disgustin', mind start to wonder about this world we in
Then it's back on the phone, I'm fightin' with my girl again
Shit... I never been normal, as a youngin'
I was in black clothes, they close the portal on me
Talkin' shit but you foldin' more than origami
I'm fuckin' awesome, better run along and call your mommy
'Cause we droppin' bombs more than atom do
Still we posted up on Penn Avenue

[Chorus]
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)
