[Intro]
What's the matter with you?
Don't be sad
It's going to get better

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I'm from a place where the sun don't shine
Mistakes that I made— do 'em one more time (Uh!)
Outta space, I been up so high
See the shade in the world
But the love I find is worth it
And I ain't perfect
Need a telescope just to find my purpose (yeah)
I've been coloring outside the lines (line)
I've been coloring outside the lines
And I need—
A new car to come with a new house
Taking it too far, what do I do now?
Baby, just cool out
Pick you up when you down
You feelin' stuck, why don't you move on up?
Okay, my mind is dirty— my whiskey neat
Are you in a hurry? Are you in a dream?
Be you, can only be us
Little bit of love— shit I don't need much
(No, I don't need much)

[Pre Chorus: Mac Miller + ????]
It's going to get better
Love comes around the corner
(Be a little patient, be a little patient)
I know that you've been waiting so long
So long for life to go on
(Be patient, be patient)

[Chorus: Mac Miller + ????]
Just hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Good morning! Yeah
Maximize the time you have to find the path
The smile hide behind the iron mask
I'm alive, I'm alive and well
Will I die?  Only time will tell (Let's go!)
Take a journey, find yourself a meaning
Am I worthy? I am just a human being
Full of secrets, stupid dreams
Return to miracles like turnin' steering wheels (I)
Pray for a life like this
Bunch of fake friends and a high price bitch
What the limelight is, I'll be fine
See my mind when I'm wind
I've been blind to the signs I miss
Yeah I'm—
On my prime time shit
Don't even know where the sidelines is
Gotta little bit of weed and a sci-fi flick
Left a bitch, get her off of my dick
Motherfucker, God— damn

[Pre Chorus: Mac Miller + ????]
It's going to get better
Love comes around the corner
(Be a little patient, be a little patient)
I know that you've been waiting so long
So long for life to go on
(Be patient, be patient)

[Chorus]
Just hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
