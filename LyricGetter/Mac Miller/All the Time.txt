[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh
Uh
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
When you're fin'ly gettin' paid everything be feelin' great
Went from diggin' in the crates to chillin', gettin' faded (Faded)
Don't live a normal life, but I hope you can relate
And it's hard to see it right, blowin' smoke in all your faces (Faces)
Coolin' at the crib, can't believe it's where I live
Can't believe this what I'm doin', can't believe I got this big (Big)
Can't believe this what I'm drivin', can't believe this what I'm wearin'
Yeah, the Benz is pretty cool, but I need me a McLaren
When you see me out in public, dap me up, say, "What's good?" (What's good?)
Don't need to take a picture, it's better if you look (Look)
Going for your Queen, give a fuck about a rook
Papa was a player; took some pages from his book (All the time)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
To the seven telly and it's peanut butter jelly (Jelly)
Chillin' with the homies, smoking weed and watching Belly (Belly)
Headed to the deli, rollin' with some Pirelli's
Now I'm gettin' money like 2001 Nelly (Woo)
They wanna take my photo (Photo,) my finger in my nose though
Dutch's from the Cogos, playin' water polo
Above the ozone, young Han Solo
You start rapping and I'm like no no no no no, no
Do you get it? Tell me, can you feel it? (Feel it)
I'm only gonna get a bottle from you if you steal it (Steal it)
Time on this money, money all the time (Time)
Lookin at me funny cause your money in decline (All the time)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Big bankroll, bro, loads of Franklins
Stack that dough, go get your paper (Oh)
Dividends could devastate ya
Make it but don't let it make ya
Big bankroll, bro, loads of Franklins (Woo)
Stack that dough, go get your paper (Woo)
Dividends could devastate ya (Woo)
All the time

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time (All the time)

[Outro]
All the time
All the time
All the time
All the...
