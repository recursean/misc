[Verse 1]
Let me look inside your funky mind
Let's take a ride to the place where love gets made
I need direction to your dimension
I— am not afraid to die
Cause Heaven got no gravity
I'ma float away, my spaceship make it out this galaxy
Have you seen the world beyond the boundaries?
I feel your love around me
I'm safe in outer space
And these vibrations will create a high
I was made to fly, on my way up
Let it ride, and away I'ma take ya

[Chorus]
I'ma space traveler
(Let me take you on a ride)
I'm an outer space traveler
(I will infiltrate your mind)
Just a lonely space traveler
(Love takes the pain away)
I'm an outer space traveler
(As I wander through my crazy brain)

[Verse 2]
Will you let me lift the sins within your soul?
I fear I've lost control
The devil lives inside my home
Yeah, I lost my mind while tryin' to find forever
Tryin' to buy adventure
Feel the music set you free
I just want to live inside the ecstasy
Do you trust in your reflection?
(Love yourself)
Are you stuck in one direction?
(Move yo body, mo-move yo body)
Will you find your way to Heaven?
(Will you make it out alive?)
Yeah, before the world ends?
Yeah, before the world ends?

[Chorus]
I'ma space traveler
(Let me take you on a ride)
Liquor say the magic word
I'm an outer space traveler
(I will infiltrate your mind)
Just a lonely space traveler
(Love takes the pain away)
I'm an outer space traveler
(As I wander through my crazy brain)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, he a space traveler
Off the liquor he a wizard, say the magic words
Outer space, Captain Kirk
Flow creatin' massacres
Gettin' back to work to feed the scavengers
That freaky shit, I keep a bitch who pussy smell like lavender
Yeah, every day a payday— peep the calendar
Yeah, the flow is mathematics, speakin' algebra
I'm a rare breed, don't nobody scare me
The shit again
It's Fisherman, Larry
