[Intro: Pharrell]
You see that glow, that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
You see that glow, that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
Here we go!

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Pharrell]
I fuck around with them playmates (Oh)
20 thousand my day rate (Oh)
Eating seven course meals now
People say that I gained weight (Ha)
All you rappers you ain’t safe, more money, same face
Been the shit, still the shit
Just double up, exchange rate (Hahaha)
Guess who just grown up now? (Now)
Dockin' up, sit the fuck down (Down)
Had to speak to P, said I need a beat
To show these clowns I don’t fuck around (Oh)
Asking me about money (Money)
Wonder what’s my net worth (Net worth)
People try to come sue me
But I call up J.G. Wentworth (Yeah)
I glow, they don’t (Don't)
I suppose that I'm dope (Dope)
Spend 10 racks on my coat (Coat)
Fuck a whip just bought me a boat (Boat)
My flow (Flow) is gross (Gross)
Used to be bread (Get it?), now it's toast
Want that one? You reaching
You ain't close (Get it?), no (No)

[Hook: Pharrell]
Oh you ain’t know? (Oh you ain’t know?)
Since I was born (Since I was born)
My mind was gone (My mind was gone)
Know I was poor, girl, my mind made me rich
I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (Wrist was cold)
My world was snow (My world was snow)
What I need light for? (Huh?)
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow (So special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (Huh?)
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I'm so special)
I’m so special (So special)
I’m so special (Say what?)
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rap a lot (Huh), rap a lot (Huh)
Don’t be afraid, it’s just aftershock
That jam like when Shaq grab the rock
I’m going in like a Magic shot
Your raps sweet like apricots
Shut the fuck up, you don’t have to talk
I’ma lay back with my ass on top
Got the game on Master Lock, motherfucker (Let's go)
You don’t see cash a lot
Bitch, stop acting like you bad; you not
I put my dick in her ass and twat
She look back, like, "That's the spot" (Huh)
Homie, I’m counting money
Play around with money (Money)
Y’all ain’t shit without your money (Nope)
Life ain't all about the money
Well, it kinda is if you out of money (Woo!)
Mac Millions, that’s the name
Most Dope, that’s the gang (Gang)
Drunk bitch, so glad she came
Saw her taking off her clothes, tryin' have a train (Haha)
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us, with no rubbers
Fuck that, we fuck make 'em each other
On tour, we make her fuck the runner, motherfucker
Just the shit that you need (Need)
You ain’t fucking 'round with my team (Team)
'Cause we living all of your dreams
Here to kill your self-esteem (Huh)
And my flow, that's pyro
Smoking blunts 'til my eyes close (Close)
Middle finger up high, though (Fuck 'em)
End the song on a high note

[Hook: Pharrell]
Oh you ain’t know? (Oh you ain’t know?)
Since I was born (Since I was born)
My mind was gone (My mind was gone)
Know I was poor, girl, my mind made me rich
I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (Wrist was cold)
My world was snow (My world was snow)
What I need light for? (Huh?)
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow (So special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (Huh?)
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow (I’m so special)
