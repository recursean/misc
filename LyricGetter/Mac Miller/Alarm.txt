Yeah
Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
Okay you can't get down, till you get up
Yeah you got the whole world in your hands
Homie network(And what)
We got you surrounded, this a motherfuckin' setup(Blaw)
I'm a motherfuckin' God, bow your head let me bless ya(Motherfuckin' bless ya)
Step up to the plate, better count your blessings(Woo)
People dyin' everyday, I know sometimes it get too hard(Woo, okay)
You try to get away, take a pill for the pleasure
Take something for the pain, make a deal with the devil
You just gotta sign your name, on the dotted line(Uh-huh)
And all you'll see is dollar signs, God is good all the time(Uh-huh)
Good and evil, walk the line(Line)
Couple suicidal thoughts tend to cross your mind(Okay)
But everything will be alright-alright-alright-alright

[Chorus]
Will it be okay, you can put a smile on
Dealin' with old pain, c'mon just put your smile on
Standin' in cold rain, cryin' the whole day
Your face is tellin' me, everything that you don't say
Yeah, I can't seem to figure this out
Round and round we go-o, on this never endin' road-o
Sometimes I feel I'm stuck in this cloud
But you won't keep me down
You won't keep me down
You won't keep me down
You won't keep me down
Cause I'm up now, yeah
No more time to cry, I can take you on a ride, yeah
Said I'm up now, yeah
All the pain that's inside, everything is alright, yeah
Said it's time to get up now, yeah
Open up your eyes, I can teach you how to fly
Ain't nobody gon' keep you down
It won't keep you down
It won't keep you down
It won't keep you down no more

[Verse 2]
And why all the good girls in love with the bad guys?
Baby this your world, its all that we have
My thoughts are runnin' so fast
All of this money it ain't nothing to brag, about
Shit I graduated call my name, see the cap and gown
And I was stressin', I was goin' through depression
I just had to learn my lesson, but I'm feelin' pretty happy now
Shit that had me down, same shit I laugh about
What go around always come back around baby
I turn my life around, that's a one-eighty
Don't give a fuck, I just been havin' fun lately
Went a little crazy, lost my mind
My homies had to come and get me
I done crossed that line

[Chorus]
Will it be okay, you can put a smile on
Dealin' with old pain, c'mon just put your smile on
Standin' in cold rain, cryin' the whole day
Your face is tellin' me, everything that you don't say
Yeah, I can't seem to figure this out
Round and round we go-o, on this never endin' road-o
Sometimes I feel I'm stuck in this cloud
But you won't keep me down
You won't keep me down
You won't keep me down
You won't keep me down
Cause I'm up now, yeah
No more time to cry, I can take you on a ride, yeah
Said I'm up now, yeah
All the pain that's inside, everything is alright, yeah
Said it's time to get up now, yeah
Open up your eyes, I can teach you how to fly
Ain't nobody gon' keep you down
It won't keep you down
It won't keep you down
It won't keep you down no more
