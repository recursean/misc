[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, my good days are exactly like the bad ones
My bitch say that I defy the laws of attraction
I've always been terrified of endin' up normal
Things that we all search for end up findin' us
God is like the school bell, He won't tell you when your time is up
Shit just end up workin' out, why do we wonder why it does?
Yeah, so I asked God to take me on a perfect date
Swear I saw him cryin', don't know why everyone sure it’s rain
Education's shiftin', but I feel we only learn from change
Every time I think about it, shit just starts to hurt my brain
Problems we can't solve always seem to be my favorite ones
Life just gets so borin', playin' superhero makes it fun
So why is "heroism" so close to "heroin"? (Heroin)

[Chorus: Dylan Reynolds]
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as freedom
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I’m dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, they tell you that you need to sleep and suddenly you do
Scared you gon' wake up as someone who isn't you
We've all been down that road before
Poured alcohol on open sores
Nobody can hurt me if I go inside and close the door
Not scared of growin' old and dyin'
Feel this where the answer lives
You wear the garments
Everybody needs to dress some manikins (Make some noise)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dylan Reynolds]
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as dreamin'
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I'm dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead

[Outro]
Make some noise
