[Chorus]
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy

[Verse 1]
Sleep on a plane, wake up in a different state
Rock the stage, get paid and off to a different date
College boys come up offerin' me their haze
And hoes be approachin' me offerin' me some brain (Haha)
I can't complain, people show me love (Love)
Actin' like they know me, but no one really does (Nah)
I say "What up?" and appreciate support
But if you sparkin' conversation, please just make it short
'Cause I ain't got time for no monkey business (Nah)
I stay on the grind for the money in it (Money in it)
I know I'm cool, I definitely rhyme well
Tellin' jokes to these hoes: Jerry Seinfeld (Haha)
See you boo, you can come and meet the crew (Crew)
No one makin' moves like me and Q (Q)
And Big Will got the triple Es locked down
I got all your lil sisters on my jock now
At the bar, no I.D. on me (On me)
Every girl's eyes be on me
Approach 'em, "Why you so lonely?
I'd introduce myself, but you already know me"

[Chorus]
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy

[Verse 2]
Almost famous, see me standin' on the rooftop
High like some tube socks, puttin' on a jukebox
Billboard status, y'all know my face
'Cause I got buzz like a phone on vibrate
Take what's on your plate (What?,) put it on my plate
'Cause I'm hungry and I don't got time to wait (Nah)
I like my ladies fine, kinda how the wine taste (Wine taste)
Hit it from behind, that's a blind date (Aha)
See, the life of a fly boy funny (Fly boy funny)
Always try and multiply more money (More money)
Yeah, I'm cocky and they love it, too (Love it, too)
Walk up in your crib like, "Who the fuck is you?" (Who the fuck is you?)
Sike, try and be a little modest
'Cause I don't have enough paper in my wallet (Not yet)
Parents think I'll be somewhere in a college (Nah)
But I disagree, I'll be somewhere livin' prosperous (Prosperous)
There's a lot of things that I ain't got yet (got yet)
Way we progress kinda hard to process (process)
How I'm so young, such a prospect?
I'm still crawlin', I ain't even start to walk yet (Haha)

[Chorus]
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy
