No
Yeah
No

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ugh, passport, filling it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan (Yeah)
She keep on asking for a rack, so I ran
Looking back, like, you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more (No more)
'Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more (No more)
If money buy you love (Love), then love's not enough ('Nough)
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance
Would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray
But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?
Might have a baby on the way
Cause I been going in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was (Was)
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch (Touch)
I need to feel that (Love), I need to feel that (pain)
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that (Rain)?
I keep my head up (High), a little fed up (Lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't (Exist), hiero-(Glyphics)
Pyro-(technics), meta-(physics)
Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card (Card)
Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far (Far)
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticon, hit it 'til my head is gone

[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]
Point me to the road (Road), and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose (Nose) to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (Never that), getting ducats
'Til I die, while my foes (Foes) busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, ugh, toasted in public (Ugh)
Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch ('Fect, bitch)
Listen up, go (Ugh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
See, this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting boujee
(See a creature) ass beauty, (Need a feature) rather shoot me
Truly, bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact
But you, in fact, assuming
Back to doing (Cash pursuing), posted up like (Patrick Ewing)
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These ... eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget, you infested in nesting crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly (Brr-r!)
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines ('Chines)
Those will make you change (Change)
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain

[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]
Point me to the road (Road), and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose (Nose) to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (Never that), getting ducats
'Til I die, while my foes (Foes) busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, ugh, toasted in public (Ugh)
Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch ('Fect, bitch)
Listen up, go
