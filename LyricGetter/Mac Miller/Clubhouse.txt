[Intro]
Yeah (Real shit), yeah (New shit), yeah

[Hook]
I done been through it all
Every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot, with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
If there's a list to the top, you could sign me up
Yeah, you could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Above ground about thirty thousand miles up
Told the bitch slow down like dial-up
She go down first and she climbing up
Wanna let me cut, tell her, "Line it up"
Little bit much, I'm a wild one (Woo)
All I do is fuck hoes, drink tiger blood (Yummy)
Since I came in the game, they been sour
I'm the plug, get your motherfuckin' power up
Mind your business, you in my office
And I go get it, I need all it
I stay lifted, smoking, sipping
Fixes fixing all my problems, yeah

[Hook]
I done been through it all
Every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot, with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
If there's a list to the top, you could sign me up
Yeah, you could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
Yeah

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo,) oh-oh-oh-oh (Good mornin')
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I was a nobody, now my name's on the list
Couple  keys of uncut cocaine on the wrist
And I let my nuts hang on a bitch
All the money that we spend on champagne is ridiculous
And it is us, elixir in my cup
Give the bitches drugs, a dick to suck
And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me (Yeah)
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth
Came for a steak but I left with the cow
And they hate when you great though
Ain't shit change but my checking account (Mac Milly)

[Hook]
I done been through it all
Every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot, with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
If there's a list to the top, you could sign me up
Yeah, you could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
They can't bring me down, can't bring me down, can't bring me down with you
Ca—, you ca—, ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-can't bring me down
