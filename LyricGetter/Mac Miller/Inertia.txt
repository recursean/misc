[Verse]
I've been a God way before a synagogue
Liquor drops used to hit the spot like a cinderblock
This is not what you wanted, but this is what you got
You live with what you got
Elixir that I'm mixin' like I'm in the kitchen whippin' rock
I'm in the spot like the middle of a prison box
And you ain't nothin' to the planet but a little dot
Suddenly hit the water like the line that's on a fishin' rod
Simple thoughts got me itchin' like the chicken pox
Knitted socks, with fingers tryna scratch a lotto ticket off
When I made it, I was gettin' all the bitches off
See, I was faded, now I'm countin' up the minutes lost
I throw 'em back like opponents hit a homer
My mind, it holds explosion like a pose that's on a poster
I'm out the holster with it
I overdid it like the way the roller coaster spinnin'
Homie, that's inertia
I'm the moon to the sun, how I birth ya
Turn ya, back to ya old ways, reverse ya
Curse ya, witchcraft
You get nothin' but a whole lot of nothin'
With your mothafuckin' bitch ass
You simple as a whistle, never pick a side
Shit, you always in the middle, never down to ride
I was high like I'm born to fly
Never die, I'm immortalized, here before ya eyes
Lord of the flyest, I is your highness
And no diamond when the shine ultraviolet
You on your bullshit, I'm on assignment
And I be on it like a stylus on a PalmPilot
I'm God's finest work, this way beyond timeless
Copped the new presidential Rollie, keep the watch silent
'Cause everybody tickin' me off
I got the world with her legs open, lickin' the box, shit
She home wet, sweatin' me for phone sex
Don't stress, daddy'll be home soon
And assume I'm down low with the post moves
I come through and hit the hole like Jones-Drew, yeah
My old chick is old news
But add fuel to fire, what I won't do
So, I just kick it with the homies like I'm supposed to
And we go back like gold hoops
Well, this the cold feelin', bone chillin', borderline dope dealin'
I'm goin' up with no ceilin', shit
Out of body, got my soul swimmin'
And no different, good head keep my toes twitchin'
You know Larry been fishin' since he in the womb
This the scoop up the Big Dipper, you the little spoon
Went from invisible and minuscule
To invincible, dancin' with the Benes moves
I made a million and it killed me
My second million got me mothafuckin' filthy
You ain't nothin' 'til you die and come back to life iller
They haven't made a mothafucker realer, Mr. Miller, yeah
