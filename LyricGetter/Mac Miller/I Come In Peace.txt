[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ok, it's the high flyin', sky divin'
Hoes tell me five diamonds, mine and whinin'(Okay)
Droppin' gems with the finest timin'(Woo)
I'm eatin' acid, start to burn away my stomach linin'
Comin' with that fuckin' violence
Where's chaos, love is silent(Wow)
My mom should've had another son(For real)
Maybe that would make my crazy ass less troublesome(Wee)
I come in peace, but unleash this fuckin' beast inside me
You may need to CSI, investigate the scene when I leave(Woo, woo, woo)
I start drinkin' whats inside my IV
I'm poison ivy and my voice is whiny
New car, yeah my toys is shiny
Drive it in the river, break the ice
Skate Monongahela in the winter
I'm a ninja, I might kick ya in your fuckin' head
This is Pittsburgh, you lookin' like a fuckin' guest
I got a mayor fuckin' bitches in the south-side
Tell 'em they can get a job, just to open up your mouth wide
You Mrs. Doubtfire, fake ass bitch(Biotch)
I keeps it constipated, we don't take no shit
Nothin' for these hoes, lego my eggo trick
I'm a real a-hole, yeah ok
I'm with my bitch, watchin' Scandal in some Gucci sandals
Or whatever's on the movie channel
I drink whisky, start pukin' on my stupid flannel
Plot the tracin' paper, I'm just tryna recreate a Van Gogh(Muah)
The devil can't know my plans for destruction(Pow)
The angels get eliminated, process of deduction
Red lights, rushin' through it, nukes like I'm Russian(Pow)
I paid a foreign nun to bring the drugs in(Gimmie that shit)
I put the dope in the dumplings, the coke by the onion(Woah, woah)
Snort so many lines, it's disgusting
Open up the blinds, see the white light(Ugh, fuck)
I'm getting wasted with a bum, start a knife fight
Puttin' lice in my bitch bed
Drink Windex then, go and swallow a match
I got the right pipes, need to borrow some crack
Got a problem with that?
Okay, I'm doing drugs with the coastguard(Coastguard)
Smoke clouds coming through the sonar(Sonar)
I can beat my own ass with a crowbar, cause I'm so numb(Crowbar)
I don't even know where my toes are(Fatality, toes are)
This is Mozart, dope art(Mozart, dope art)
I'm gonna have a daughter, name her Rosa Parks(Rosa parks)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Dude you not from still..
You know what I'm sayin', from Pittsburg dude
You can't, you down there in Hawaii
Yeah, I'm just gunna add like
Down there doing Alohas
And jumpin' off mountains
A couple more raps, we'll get out of here
You're not down here in the south-side, I don't see you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay, look I said it, um, I'm a bitch ass bitch(Biotch)
That's why pre-teen girls be like "this that shit"(This that motherfuckin' shit)
But once they eighteen, they gon' kiss Mac's dick(Yeah)
Goddamn, I'm on some mismatch shit(The fuck is wrong man)
God hate me, the devil don't like me either
I'm posted up with a forty and a wife beater(Wassup cuhz)
Murder rappers, keep they bodies in the freezer
Snort coke and have a minor seizure
I'm lost in amnesia, threesomes with Venus
And Serena, I can dream, huh?(Woah, woah)
I really miss the lean, bruh
Bought my homie's team Jordans
Now they pissed off
Sorry, that's all I wanted to say
