[Intro]
So a lot of time
We have fun and hit with this rap shit, right?
But sometimes we just be sittin' there
You just gotta write something that, that mean something to you
More than just havin' fun, you feel me?
So this is that

[Verse 1]
Aha, look, uh, yeah
Recently life hasn't seem complete
Tryna speak the truth on each and every beat
I ain't in the streets or strugglin' to eat
I'm just stuck in a battle with defeat
I gotta go to school, get a good education
That's just a sidey's expectations
What do I do when I'm feelin' so down?
No more friends so I sit up in my house
Think about the cause, glory, and success
Momma just hopin' that I try my best
But she scared to let me fly from the nest
Wanna leave a legacy before I reach death
I got my whole, life ahead of me
To figure out my destiny
Accomplish something 'fore I rest in peace
The troubles that I reach seem to mess with me
Can't keep me up, can't rest, can't sleep
Breath go weak, heart go cold
Body feel numb, think I lost my soul
I don't know what the fuck I can do, right?
Tryna live life but attached to this mic
Light in the tunnel start to shine so bright
Wanna change the world with the rhymes I write
Uh, feelin' worthless, guzzlin' this gin
Wonder what's my purpose, something I pretend
I'm just in search for a brother or a friend
Growin' up well 'cause the color of my skin?
What can I say to that, I can't take it back
It's just the love that made me rap
Feelin' like a QB tryna take a snap
Start my life, just feel great, relax
'Cause happiness, you can't pay for that
Mind lost, lookin' for a place to crash
Now I'm back on my own, still rappin' these poems
And my eyes stay attached to the phone
But she ain't callin', she forgot
Some irony been added to the plot
They told me not to love, but I ain't listen
So now I'm missin' her and dissin' other women
My best friends is some 40s and Ls
I keep forgetting all these little-bitty stories to tell
They think 'cause I rhyme I'm like the other kind
Trapped in the times, don't even got a mind
But I'm so blind and so wise
We grind to climb, please rise
And pay respect to the dead
Go 'head let 'em rest in they bed
We still gotta live, 'cause that's life
It just don't feel right

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
One take that is comin' up [?]
And just speak, you know what I'm sayin'?
A'ight, Mac Miller
