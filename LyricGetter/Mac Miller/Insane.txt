[Hook]
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm(Insane)
You drive me insane, mhm, Insane, mhm(Insane)

[Verse 1]
Girl you got me out my muthafuckin' mind(Mind)
Here and over there
You got me dancin' on the line
You drive me up the wall
And through the ceiling(Through the ceiling)
I thought I seen it all
Till you walked into my buildin'
*Withcho* pretty brown eyes
*and your* dirty blonde hair
*you the* queen at tellin' lies
You absurd, I ain't scared
You the coffee in my cup
Every night you keep me up
You in the rari and you drunk cause

[Hook]
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm(Insane)(what you talkin' bout I don't know what you talkin' bout)
You drive me insane, mhm, Insane, mhm(Insane)what you talkin' bout I don't know what you talkin' bout)
