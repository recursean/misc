[Intro]
Did no one ever teach you how to dance?
Nobody ever taught you how to dance?
Well, well, everyone knows how to dance
There's only so much time

[Verse 1]
Yeah, somebody died today, I
I saw his picture in the funny papers
Didn't think anybody died on a Friday
Some angry banker, some kind of money trader
Recently divorced, was drunk drivin' down the highway
And drove off the bridge to his wedding song
Blew out the bass in his speakers, you can still hear the treble goin'
The hospital was useless, and everything was quiet but the music
Recently, I only meet peace when in deep sleep
Been the same dream: world safe, smile on her face
Waitin' on the other side, I wonder if he'll tend to the other side
Yeah, what your eyes see, too naive for war, and that'll screw ya
Still bet it all on the glory, hallelujah
I heard the answer in the gibberish of an old drunk
All he said was he's in no rush

[Chorus]
If I could just pay my rent by Tuesday
I bet I'd be rich by April Fools' day
The moon's wide awake, with a smile on his face
As he smuggle constellations in his suitcase
Don't you love silence?
Everything quiet but the music, everything quiet but the music
Do you love silence?
Everything quiet but the music

[Verse 2]
Somebody gave birth to a baby boy
I saw his picture in the funny papers
11 pounds, named after his uncle Gabriel
His mother cried with her lips against his soft face
Watch him bring these bright eyes into this dark place
Oh, sweet, sweet oblivion
Way before the information gets settled in
I swear to God I never wanna sin again
But I fear that (Trouble's on its way)
Yeah, the mind go with age, don't surrender
My mistake, I misplaced all of my remembers
Baby, there's a little vacation in the dresser
Take one for depression, and two for your temper

[Chorus]
If I could just pay my rent by Tuesday
I bet I'd be rich by April Fools' day
The moon's wide awake, with a smile on his face
As he smuggle constellations in his suitcase
Don't you love silence?

[Verse 3]
Oh shit, here come the icebreaker
It's danger when he's bringin' out the lightsaber
The words awesome but he's talkin' outta turn often
I blew the fuck up, then became the world's problem
Bad hygiene, all about that gross life
Hate to see somebody fuckin' up their own life
Just roll the dice, put a 20 on midnight
Have a feelin' we gon' win tonight
'Cause when the snakes start slitherin', you spot the chameleons
You realize you surrounded by reptilians
Shit, I ain't an innovator, just a motherfuckin' illustrator

[Outro]
Why does it matter, at all? Whoa, whoa
