Yeah, yeah, yeah
And the world, proceeds, to turn
Yeah

[Chorus]
I know I've been takin' way too long
Tryna make it right from wrong, tryna write your favorite song
Girl you losin' your mind
You say that you want me at my best, had to get this off my chest
Baby all you bring is stress and it's wastin' my time
But I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
The world so happy for you(Yeah, we so happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
The world real happy for you, girl

[Verse 1]
The homie told me all you need is a new bitch
Ain't that some bullshit
You a witch, all you need is the broomstick
Tryna fuck motherfuckers that I'm cool with, yeah
I'm so happy for you, I'ma break in a mattress for you
And I heard you wanna fuck the homie that's cool
I can even go and ask him for you
I don't hold grudges, these bitches don't mean nothin'
You would swear you was in love with me
You should have seen this comin'  all along
New whip, help you get around
It was all bad but it's better now
Keep a drink in your hand, never set it down
Shit, do you love her if you don't get another 'cause

[Chorus]
I know I've been takin' way too long
Tryna make it right from wrong, tryna write your favorite song
Girl you losin' your mind
You say that you want me at my best, had to get this off my chest
Baby all you bring is stress and it's wastin' my time
But I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
The world so happy for you(Yeah, we so happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
The world real happy for you, girl

[Verse 2]
He a mothafuckin' pimp, ain't he
That pussy like shrimp, tasty
I swear to god that bitch, crazy
Thought she was fuckin' slim, shady
What's gravy baby, I'll take it
Now bend it over don't break it
Better fuck the homies I came with
'Cause we started down, but we harder now
From the steel from the city we was raised in
A little bit of energy, wanna be with a celebrity
Now you nothin' but a memory
Do you love her if you don't get another 'cause

[Chorus]
I know I've been takin' way too long
Tryna make it right from wrong, tryna write your favorite song
Girl you losin' your mind
You say that you want me at my best, had to get this off my chest
Baby all you bring is stress and it's wastin' my time
But I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
I'm so happy for you(I'm so happy)
The world so happy for you(Yeah, we so happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
I'm real happy for you(I'm real happy)
The world real happy for you, girl
But I'm so happy for you
I'm so, happy, for you, for you
And I'm so happy for you
And I'm so happy for you
The world so happy for you
And I'm real happy for you
I'm so, happy, for you, for you
And I'm real happy for you
And I'm real happy for you
The world real happy for you, girl
The world real happy for you, girl
The world real happy for you, girl
