Fuck you mean, "I'm drunk," mo'fugga?
You crazy?
Shit, you didn’t say that a hour ago!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I made more than this money (Whoa), don't label me as no business (No)
Came up in this country, started out in the Civic (Yup)
Pray for rain 'til it's muddy (Muddy), prayin' more than just Sunday (Sunday)
Eatin' good, I'm still hungry, left no evidence on these dishes (Clean)
Watchin' movies, no sound (Nope), smokin' weed in this dope house (Dope)
And my bitch coked out, smoke loud when she go down (Suck a dick, bitch)
Damn, this the life (Life), ridin' on Gary Fisher bikes (Skrrt)
Know the kid is nice, piece of cake, you won't get a slice (Bitch)
Any time of night, hide your kids, hide your wife (Oh)
Find a sip, bottle Sprite (Oh), high as shit, blind a bitch, dynamite (Bang)
Bitch, tell me what your problems like (I wanna know, for real)
Just grab the pipe, we could talk all night
Sike

[Chorus]
I get money, I fuck hoes (Ya)
I wear really nice clothes, I
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (All of it!)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Bitch!)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)
I get money, I fuck hoes
I wear really nice clothes, I (They're expensive!)
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (Cash, motherfucker)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Slut-ass hoes)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)

[Verse 2]
Why the fuck did I start this? (Uh,) Now I'm spittin' retarded (Huh?)
That bassline, made that, that's the hardest (Yeah, it is)
Regardless, I could get this yardage (Ya)
'Cause I'm a quarterback, bitch, gimme my quarter back (Now)
Change, vendin' machine, make it rain (Wow)
Buyin' out the whole bottom floor, buyin' out the whole bottom drawer (Wow)
Buyin' out the whole bottom row
There's ice in my mouth right now (There's ice in my mouth right now)
Lemme chew that shit, bitch, I'm cold (Whoa)
Yeah, I'm cold, all you rappers, you old
Don't go to award shows 'cause they smell like nursing homes (Gross)
Yeah, never wanna get nominated
Yeah, I do, I'm just pissed I haven't got nominated

[Chorus]
I get money, I fuck hoes (Ya)
I wear really nice clothes, I
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (All of it!)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Bitch!)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)
I get money, I fuck hoes
I wear really nice clothes, I (They're expensive!)
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (Cash, motherfucker)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Slut-ass hoes)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)
