[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yuh, yeah, yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Cup of coffee in the mornin'
But the mornin' when the sun down
Stayin' up late night
Take a swim with great whites
All I need is day light
I'm tryna be a billionaire
She tryna' be a playwright
Something 'bout this ain't right
Paint a picture on the wall
Better use your mind and you will find
There's no such thing as law
Had that god damn in '09
That holy shit the next year
Standin' on the coast line
Your flows a bit too wet here
Most these motherfuckers are so easy to forget here
Toasted O's, you hold your own, I'm coast to coast
The poster flows, the flow is cold as overcoats
I'm blowin' smoke at police
Fuck 'em, we ain't never gonna trust 'em
Let me go free

[Chorus]
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
What's the difference 'tween a bitch and a bitch?
Well a bitch ain't a bitch when his bitch start trippin'
Shit, I been smart
Spittin' by the benchmark
Wisdom of a Templar
This shit like liftin' with my left arm
Yeah, no need to wonder who your friends are
The Devil probably comin' for your soul when it get dark
So thank God all the time and protect art
Life is the beginning, best be ready for the next part
I swear to God they gon' feel me
Better get a job and get busy
I'm like a God in my city
Don't trust nobody, my shit be crazy
Better get up off yo' ass, somebody gon' pay me
Don't keep me waitin', yeah
And only God can judge me
When all the glamour go away, you only left with money
So I'm stackin' everyday I'm at the crib in clothes that's bummy
All them things you say don't mean a thing to me
Don't trust nobody

[Chorus]
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Hold your temper
Flow can go forever
Fuck these little snakes, I got a cobra on the dresser
The flow is texture, colder than the snowy weather
You don't think that I'm the greatest
Need to get to know me better in a
Polo sweater and I'm chillin' for the weekend
Standin' in some muddy waters
Swimmin' in the deep end, yeah
My bitch is sleepin', but I'm out here livin' decent
Pissin' on the fire engine, got me shittin' on the cement
I'm a dog, but aware of all my flaws
I'm a martyr for the cause
On the run, never bring it to a jog, no
This my job, though
Hit 'em with a crossbow
While I'm at the crib makin' tacos out of waffles
The God awful
Lookin' for apostles
The flow is always dirty, but the people like it raw, though
I feel colossal
Savage man, I'm macho
Last forever, never gonna stop, no

[Chorus]
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know
