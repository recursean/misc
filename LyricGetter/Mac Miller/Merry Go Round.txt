Yeah, you see me looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at you
I know you see me looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at you
Yeah, yeah
I see you looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at me, me
You know I see you looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at

Places that you won't go
Let me tell you what you don't know
And you've been riding solo
And I've been trying to tell you
That you should come away with me
To the top floor
You know that you've been working way too hard for
You to be unhappy every day
I'll put a smile on your face
Cause' that's the way that it should be

I take my time with you
This moment could last forever
Once we on your mind
To you upon the sky
And give it to you
I made this life with you
I hold you close together
There's no compromise
We stay lost in time

Bring it back, babe
Here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on the merry go round
Merry go round, ooh baby baby
Here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on the merry go round
On the merry go round

Yeah, you see me looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at you
I know you see me looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at you
Yeah, yeah
I see you looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at me, me
You know I see you looking at, looking at, looking at, looking at me

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well, I take your momma to dinner
I take your sister to lunch
I was so happy to meet to meet her
The bill I'm picking it up
I drove you 'round in the beamer
We take a trip for the month
And every time that I see a pussy
I'm beating it up
(You'll even be stuck?)
So all you do keep-keeping it up
I'm leaving for work, I swear that I don't see you enough
And can you tell me 'bout your dreams
What you believin' an stuff
I was waiting for a we, like when are we gonna fuck, yeah

I take my time with you, forever
There's nothing we can't do together
Woah, Queen
You can be my queen
My queen
