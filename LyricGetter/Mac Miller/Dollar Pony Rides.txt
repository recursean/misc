[Verse 1]
Said, it ain't about money, I could show you the world girl
What can't you do for me, we can take a vacation
Go somewhere in the country
Turn the radio on hear my song say (Whoa-oh-oh)
My favorite song say (Whoa-oh-oh)
She don't know, she slept through the future
Missed it, it was yesterday
So we (We), right (Right), back, where we started
She still tryna get away (Get away)
Girl you wastin' my time and I am wastin' your time
But that's okay, said it's okay
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Let me give you what you want, ou
Maybe later what you need, yeah
I remember girl you used to have fun, yeah
Well I ain't seen a smile in a while
Heard you feelin' pretty lonely, yeah
Your daddy should have got you that pony
Let me give you what you want

[Verse 2]
Killin' yourself like this, gon' crazy keepin' all of these secrets
How is that livin'
Every time I reminisce, I keep thinkin' it was better then
I remember when we made out, underneath the rain clouds
Stay, out, late I wanna lay down
Break ground and then you tell me (Whoa-oh-oh)
And we could be okay don't know for sure (We, we, we don't know)
Just familiar numbers glimmer through your door
You left home, right away, 'cause your life is like night and day
You keep goin', goin', goin' back and forth

[Chorus]
Let me give you what you want, ou
Maybe later what you need, yeah
I remember girl you used to have fun, yeah
Well I ain't seen a smile in a while
Heard you feelin' pretty lonely, yeah
Your daddy should have got you that pony
Let me give you what you want

[Outro]
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Can I give you want you need
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Can I give you want you want
Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I
Can I give you want you need, what you need
What do you need girl, yeah
Said can I give you what you want
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Can I give you want you need
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Said can I give you want you want
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Can I give you want you need, what you need
What do you need girl?
