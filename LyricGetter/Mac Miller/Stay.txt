[Intro: Mac Miller]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Said, just a little while
Just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, hold up
Wait a motherfuckin' second (Wait a second), I know you stressin'
You don't gotta keep me guessin' (Keep me guessin'), I'm full of questions
In return I get the silent treatment (Ssh), I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say it's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'? (Oh my God)
I could have a whole collection, just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Said, just a little while
Just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'ma go crazy, girl, you save me, meditate me, give me peace of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high, lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between the lines
Binge watched Sopranos, made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come to see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Said, just a little while
Just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Just a little while, just a little while, babe?

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
The way you walk in to the room, oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more (Hell no)
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walk in to the room, oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more (Hell no)
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go, girl?

[Chorus (Extended): Mac Miller]
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Just a little while (Just a little while longer)
Just a little while, just a little while (Just a little bit longer, baby)
Will you
The way you walk in to the room, oh oh
Stay just a little while
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
Babe? Said, just a little while
I don't wanna be polite no more
Just a little while, just a little, little while
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Will you
The way you walk in to the room, oh oh
Stay just a little while
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
Babe? Just a little while
I don't wanna be polite no more
Just a little while, just a little, little while
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Will you
Stay just a little while
Babe? Just a little while (Just a little while longer)
Just a little while, just a little, little while (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Outro: Paige Montgomery]
Will you...
Will you...
Will you...
Yeah, daddy
Oh yeah, right there
Oh my God!
