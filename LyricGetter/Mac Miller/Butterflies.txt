[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You smell just like lilac wine, little bit of nostalgia
Rewind back time to when I first learned to love ya
She passin' me by, she burnin' rubber
These slideshows in my mind, whoa
She play it cool, but her eyes don't lie though (Better drive slow)
If you wanna take a ride on the high road (Yeah) (Whoa)
And your mind so passionate, your love what I'm after, and
That feelin' so unfamiliar, I only imagine it
Dream girl, you're my make-believe girl

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Man]
I'ma bet it all on you, I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue? Yeah, I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl, them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies (Butterflies), butterflies stick like glue (Butterflies)
Butterflies (Butterflies), butterflies stick like glue

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
Beauty queen, beauty queen, straight out of a movie scene
Touchin' on yo' body, I could feel you in a lucid dream
This my imagination, ooh, you keep me fascinated
You are a forbidden fruit, I be apple tastin'
She is glowin', babe, I think I need a moment
I keep you open late, do you even know my name?
(Why am I a stranger?) Yeah
She dancin' on the street, it's her favorite ol' song
And she playin' out the stereo, the radio on
Do she love me like I love her? Use me when she need a lover?
Yeah, she got me under her spell, goin' rounds, ring a bell

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Kilo Kish, Unknown Man]
I'ma bet it all on you, I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue? Yeah, I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl, them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies (Butterflies) (Butterflies)
Butterflies stick like glue (Yeah) (Butterflies)
Butterflies (Butterflies) (Butterflies)
Butterflies stick like glue (Whoa)

[Bridge: Mac Miller & Kilo Kish]
There's no emotion powerful as love (Such a good point, Mac, you already said it)
There's no emotion powerful as love (I could write a cliché, but they already got it, pathetic)
There's no emotion powerful as love (Just in case: key to life, peace and love, white tux, white top)
As love, as love (Until the next time, let's keep it cool, my love)

[Outro: Kilo Kish]
Um, but really, Mac, you're kind of a bitch though
Just saying
Okay, bye
