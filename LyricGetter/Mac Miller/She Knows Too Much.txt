Woo, electrifyin'
Mesmerizing
Wooah
Oh, feel good don't it
You're God damn right
But it feel so wrong
You're God damn right

[Chorus]
She, way outta my league
Can't buy her love(Baby, can't buy her love)
All them book she read
She know way too much(She knows way too much)
Girl, if you don't know me
You don't know enough(She don't know me)
Said, if you don't know me
You don't know enough(She don't know me)

[Verse 1]
Said, oh we(Yeah)
Got me sayin' baby(Hell yeah)
You can drive my car
But don't drive me crazy(Girl you drive me wild, skrt)
I know that life is hard
We dancin' on the boulevard
Girl am I crazy(Crazy)
I must be crazy(Crazy)

[Verse 2]
Um, yeah
Ya got trouble payin' rent now
Livin' in apartment
I can take you to the pent house(Ching)
Got a step child, gone like an exile
Make me say "Wooh", every time you pull your breasts out
She got so much love, I'm feelin' left out
I can be your drug, don't get stressed out
I know you say it's true love
But why you always hit me
When the check bounce
Ooh, yeah we in love
Tell me what I gotta do
To get my dick sucked
She a pin up, lookin' for a rich one
Need to take your ass on home
Pick ya kid up(Pick your God damn kid up)
Yeah, hard movin' of the kick drum
You ain't have none, girl better get some
We can talk about the Universe and energy
But all you really want is a celebrity(You motherfuckin' bitch)
(And that was cold-hearted, you're just lost, and I'm here to find you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
She, way outta my league
Can't buy her love(Baby, can't buy her love)
All them book she read
She know way too much(She knows way too much)
Girl, if you don't know me
You don't know enough(She don't know me)
Said, if you don't know me
You don't know enough(She don't know me)
