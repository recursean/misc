Oh yeah

[Hook]
Yeah
This is everything he dreamed of
Isn't it(Isn't it)
Now that you here why does it feel so different(Uh huh)
I bet you feelin' so infinite(Uh huh)
And you don't gotta worry bout shit again(Shit again)
Brand new crib
Who let all these bitches in
Fuck it if they fine
Then it's fine
We just kickin' it
Get the weed
Grab a glass
Pour some liquor in
And everybody got the devil in em just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Ohh used to be so innocent
Used to study everyday
Get nothing but some A's
Till the money never came
Oh what a shame isn't it(Isn't it, Isn't it)
And this shit feel just like some good pussy
Those days that you skipped school playin' hooky
This shit feel like some head in the middle of the day
Get you wet, got you signin' in the rain
I'm just sayin'
Let me stunt a bit, stunt a bit(Bit)
I'm just havin' fun with it, I'm drunk as shit
My bitch stayin' sober, so I'm lettin' her drive
While I'm in the passenger seat
Like how the fuck this shit happen to me
I wished I cared, I don't give a shit
Aware I'm a citizen
Are you there are you listenin'
It ain't a light if it's flickerin'
You see I just wanna shine
See Mister Fishermen

[Hook]
Yeah
This is everything he dreamed of
Isn't it(Isn't it)
Now that you here why does it feel so different(Uh huh)
I bet you feelin' so infinite(Uh huh)
And you don't gotta worry bout shit again(Shit again)
Brand new crib
Who let all these bitches in
Fuck it if they fine
Then it's fine
We just kickin' it(Woo)
Get the weed
Grab a glass
Pour some liquor in
And everybody got the devil in em just a little bit

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I told myself once I hold my own checks
That I would go and buy myself a gold rolex
I was sayin' oh yes
But I don't know yet
They told me take it slow homie don't flex(Don't stress)
And all these lil bitches you don't pose no threat
See I been around for years
I'm a most dope vet
I be stone cold stuntin'
Got a know don't guess(Don't guess)
Ion't hear none of y'all
I'm so so deaf(Woo)
Homie you just gotta let it go don't stress(Stress)
I just wanna smoke a lil weed and have sex
When I hit it from behind
See I make that ass stretch
Only fuck with tens
You bitch got bad breath
All I do is get high and cash checks
Call a bitch over
Map pussy address
Success and mad stress
That pussy mad wet
Gimmie head crack necks
Heard she a hoe, we gon' know
When we fact check
She like to call me daddy
Probably cause her dad left
The science don't know what I am
They runnin' lab tests
Gotta long way to go
With all that gas left
Rather have more than have less
I'm in the booth rappin'
And I'm gettin' that head
Wanna put it in her pussy
And she tell me that's next
I don't fear nothing
I don't even fear death
Keep going till till my last breath

[Hook]
This is everything he dreamed of
Isn't it(Isn't it)
Now that you here why does it feel so different(Uh huh)
I bet you feelin' so infinite(Uh huh)
And you don't gotta worry bout shit again(Shit again)
Brand new crib
Who let all these bitches in
Fuck it if they fine
Then it's fine
We just kickin' it
Get the weed
Grab a glass
Pour some liquor in
And everybody got the devil in em just a little bit

[Verse 3]
Yeah
I do it hippo large
Spit those bars
Boutta quarter million
I whip those cars
Being rich so hard
Sniff those bars
And it seem like every time I make a hit go yard
My bitch in love with my dick so far
She love to swallow
Said "this shit low carb"
You better sit right down
This shit gon' start
Because this my town
It's Pittsburgh park
All the drugs I did so far
I'm just hopin' that my dick get hard
