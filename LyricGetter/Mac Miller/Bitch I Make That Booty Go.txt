[Intro]
Get the, fuck outta my face
Byah

[Verse 1]
I wake up, rub my eyes
Dry vomit on my shirt
The light bulb goes off my conscience is alert
My ex girl hate me and the talkin' never work
My demons have no reason and that monster be the worst
Who lived this life well? I'm possibly the first
Gotta saga, back by popular demand, I been honest man
All my life, it's just the real, it ain't the wrong or right
You think the bitches wanna fuck you 'cause your songs is nice?
Blood stains on my shirt, must had an awesome night
Reincarnate, Ray Charles before he lost his sight
I'm on the mic like, Jordan Nikes, try to sell my soul
But the devil broke, he can't afford the price
Shootin' pornos havin' boogie nights
You a cookie cutter motherfucker, pussy type
Sometimes I feel so blue but I'm still lookin' white
Shit I'm just like you, you said you just like who?
Well I bust right through like enough when you love life too much in a plush white suit, shine what the fuck lights do
And my wife just like her pussy 'cause she up tight too
Bro this my crib, where I live, who the fuck invite you?
I'm a fat bitch addict, love my plus sized boo
I told her roll over that roll over, that's fun times two
Don't get it twisted 'cause these bitches basically love dykes too
I pulled up, pulled out, soon as I come I'm through, shit

[Hook]
This, is, the hook (Yeah)
This, is, the hook (Yeah)
This, is, the hook (Yeah, yeah)
This, is, the hook
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Nobody guardin' this, had it locked up before I started it
Retarded shit, kinda like my father but don't Mark a bit
You see I make it then they market it
Parked the whip in San Diego, findin' out where Carmen lives
These are my hungover thoughts, I'm so ashamed in Notre Dame
With a hunched over walk, yeah
I like my bitches when they fuck more than talk
And have the halos of an angel hidden up in a box
This evil is the easel that we paint upon
And those divas ain't no divas with no make-up on
I'm in the bed, she give me head like, "what's taking long?"
I'm like "it's hard to finish when this fuckin' Drake is on"
But it's my favorite song, I'm concentrated on the cord change
My impure brain, take it all the way, ignore pain
"Why you suck my dick like it's a chore babe?"
I'ma turn these kids into a short stain
I'm too nice, always givin' you what you like
You can trust me, I'm like Dudley, I always do right
Bitches love me, must be the money I'm on it tonight
Get the action then send her packed on the Jetblue flight
And nobody wanna fuck with a legend, I be on my shit
On a trip twenty-four seven, if you scared go to church
I'm the God, I'm the Reverend
Most Dope be the squad that I'm reppin', shit

[Hook]
This, is, the hook(Yeah)
This, is, the hook(Yeah)
This, is, the hook
This, is, the [censored]
