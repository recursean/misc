[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
Went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
Think I was blind before I met you
Don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

[Chorus 1]
So I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wonder if I could come home

[Verse 2]
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, "This is the first day of my life
I didn't die before I met you
But now, I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"

[Chorus 2]
So if you want to be with me
With these things, there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'm working for a paycheck
Instead of waiting to win the lottery
