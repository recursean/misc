[Hook]
Yeah, never had a lot but I made a lot
They told a story I changed the plot
Now I'm saving up for that plenty yacht
Them extra channels that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good but that pain is not
They say, damn you changed a lot but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe, woah, woah
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
Said they don't know my bitch's name no
No, and I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
What's your life like?
She'll, come back for the right price
Might, blind you with them bright lights
No one want to be Christ like
Shit too hard, still wanna figure out who you are
The drugs in my system they worried, I took it too far
But, but, but I built this mo-, Motherfucker I built this and
And, along the way I never made a kill switch cause
Cause, I won't stop till my heart give, and stop ticking like a old clock
They knock, knock, knock, knock my door lock
It won't open up for no one
My head up, I keep going
They thinking I should slow up
Explode, I been shaking up the soda
Hol' up, this mine don't touch
They see my white skin, eyes lit up they saying gold rush
I'm, still eating breakfast some Cocoa Puffs
I can't sleep my eyes just won't shut
My mum thinks I'm doing too much
They say slow down, don't rush

[Hook]
Yeah, never had a lot but I made a lot
They told a story I changed the plot
Now I'm saving up for that plenty yacht
Them extra channels that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good but that pain is not
They say, damn you changed a lot but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe, woah, woah
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
Said they don't know my bitch's name no
No, and I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
I'm, waking up from this coma
Called her on the mobile phone
Asking her if she's going home
She's still sleeping over
I might have lost my fax so
I could probably use a loaner
No more, she's playing poker
Once I moved to California
She lost a lot of that trust in me
Can't say she don't get a rush when she 'fuck-give' me
Subsequently I'm praying to an angel
Where did all the pain go?
So unstable, the cocaine is on the table

[Bridge]
Girl let's take off, let's get out of here
Go on, go on, a different atmosphere awaits us
I tend to talk a lot and you don't say much
But everything I say just ain't enough no
Said I need to let that love show
You knock me down so fast, I'm getting up slow
Yeah, everything ain't perfect
Standing there on judgment day, like was it all worth it? Uh

[Hook]
Yeah, never had a lot but I made a lot
They told a story I changed the plot
Now I'm saving up for that plenty yacht
Them extra channels that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good but that pain is not
They say, damn you changed a lot but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe, woah, woah
Said they don't know my bitch's name
Said they don't know my bitch's name no
No, and I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings babe, woah, woah
