[Intro: Mac Miller]
You see I spent a lot of time thinkin'
This my life and shit

[Chorus 1: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar (Yeah)
Dream large, and it'll go so far (What?), so far (What?), so far, so far (Haha)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (What?), I'm on my way (What?)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (What?), I'm on my way (Aha)
I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
(Let's go)
I'm hands-down the illest to do it my age (Age)
I can see the words conversate on my page (My page)
The sentences stay jumpin' off the can'bis
All these metaphors and my pretzels starts to panic
Writin' so much the margin seem to vanish
Beatin' up a track gotta get a song a bandage (Haha)
Pictures all candid, feature presentation
Gonna make a movie out of every occasion
They can't stand it, that's why I got 'em hatin'
Blood pressure risin', heart start raisin'
Work hard, fuck a calory, I burn bars (Burn bars)
Pedal to the metal they'll earn hard
Everywhere I go, all the girls say I'm sexy
Tell 'em I can change they whole world if they let me (Wassup baby)
Get me, a million people to speak to
I'm on my way right now
But I see you (Peace)

[Chorus 2: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far (So far), so far (So far), so far (So far)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (What?) (Ho), I'm on my way (Ho)
I'm on my way (Haha), I'm on my way, I'm on my way (You already know) (Verse two)
I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, I'm on my way to the top of the world
But first I gotta get up off the top of your girl
A lot of distractions, no relaxin'
Money, music, promo, tourin', imagin', and ya fashion (Ching!)
All gotta be right
Then you get your cream right (Cream right)
But it's work, I ain't left the lab in three nights
My girl and me fight, sayin' I don't care
I got a lot of time and she sayin' I don't share (Gimme that)
When you on your way up to royalty
You gotta check all your people's loyalty (Haha)
See the Murray hot today
So I gotta keep it pushin', 'cause I'm on my way!

[Chorus 3: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far (So far), so far (So far), so far (So far)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way (Where you goin'?), I'm on my way
I'm on my way (Where you headin'), I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way (Break it down now)

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I got a ways to go (Uh-oh!)
But homie you don't know my name (Yessir)
People say that I change, but it's so hard to stay the same (Bring it back like)
So relax, relax, there's no need to worry (Nah)
Time is on my side now
There's no need to hurry (Haha)

[Chorus 4: Palermo Stone & Mac Miller]
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar (Yeah)
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far (So far), so far (So far), so far (So far)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way (Where you goin'?), I'm on my way, I'm on my way (Where you headin'?)
I'm on my way

[Outro: Mac Miller]
So like I said
You on a way right now
I'll tweet you later
Aha!
So I see you ma
Peace
