[Intro]
Hmm-mm
Hmm-mm-mm
Hmm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
What will exist in forever?
Forever nothin' without truth
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news
Love will exist in forever
Forever nothin' without you
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news

[Verse]
Rain, always
The state of mind, flooded brain
Thoughts keep racin' by, jump and pray
Away we fly, day by day
Travel through space and time, save the day
Baby, you wastin' time, a-okay
Make up your crazy mind, fade away
Don't you fade away into an area of grey

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh) We are, we are everything but plain
(Ooh-ooh) We are, we are shinin' in the shade
(Ooh-ooh) I am Poseidon on the waves

[Chorus]
What will exist in forever?
Forever nothin' without truth
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news
Love will exist in forever
Forever nothin' without you
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news
