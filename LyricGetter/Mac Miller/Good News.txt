[Verse 1]
I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealing, yeah
Get everything I need then I'm gone, but it ain't stealing
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
But maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like you when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 2]
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
Yeah, it's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's a problem with a closed door

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like you when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 3]
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

[Outro]
No more, no more, no more, no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm
