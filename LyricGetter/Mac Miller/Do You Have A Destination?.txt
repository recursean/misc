[Intro]
Alright
Let's get started
Woo, yeah
You can feel it, yeah
Can you feel it?
Vibrations, yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay I went to sleep faded then I woke up invisible
Keep the ingredients, but I got the kitchen full
Thoughts are cynical, actions unpredictable
Super models bitches hold auditions in my swimmin' pool
And this feelin', is feelin' pretty invincible (I know)
Pray this life reciprocal and I'ma come back an eagle
Thirsty for evil, the wine chilled in Hell (Right here)
I gave my life to this shit, already killed myself
No-no-no-no-no
We ain't the same homie (No)
The world afraid to change but it changed on me (Woah)
Always been the realest keep the same homies (Uh-uh)
So that bullshit fades slowly

[Chorus]
It's goin'
Goin', goin, goin', goin' goin', goin, goin', goin'
Will you follow? (Gone)
Where are you goin'?
Watch it go, go, go, where are you goin' for real? Go, go, go
Where are you goin'? Go, go, go, go, go, go
Okay
Gone-gone, gone-gone

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Okay I went to sleep famous and I woke up invisible
Rich as fuck and miserable
At least I did Kimmel and Aresnio, my mom got it on video
That's the shit I live for, all this other shit is trivial
Wi-wi-wi-will you bear witness to a miracle
I don't know, I'm not a kid no more, comin' for those residuals (That money)
Be asleep in a couple minutes
My bitch have a nightmare, wake up, made me some cereal
She knows I love my cereal (She knows)
The sun come up, I gotta face that
Oh my God, here we go
I'ma blow it, yeah
Am I okay? Fuck no
Just so nuts so
Need to let the drugs go
Tryna find Heaven, I get high but never come close
We still, wonder why we'll never learn to love
It's because, all the air is filled with gun smoke
A middle finger to the cyber Gods
Fall back or I'ma fuck around and let this virus off
In the mud, fuck your brainwash, I'm signin' off
Pain killer God with an upload

[Chorus]
Yeah
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Where are you goin'? Gone
Do you have a destination?
Watch it go
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?

[Outro]
Do you have a destination?
