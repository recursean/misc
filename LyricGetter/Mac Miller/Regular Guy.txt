[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ayo, fresh money
Y'all my dudes for this one

[Chorus: Phresh Muney & Mac Miller]
(?) dawg
'Cause I'm a regular guy (You know me, just a regular-ass boy)
And I ain't finna make it rain, girl
'Cause I'm a regular guy (Yeah)
My hat big dub (Uh)
I still wear chucks (Chucks)
I ran outta weed, man, that shit sucks (Sucks)
But I don't give a fuck (Na-ah)
'Cause I'm a regular guy

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
I'm just a, regular guy
Never said I was fly
But I'm higher than Willie Nelson was in '75
I spit ultra-violet rays, fans be gettin' a tan
The boy louder than some thunder, call him Kevin Durant
Hold your tongue, swallow both your hands
My people stick together like a colony of ants
No college plan, tryna get more dollars than a doctor can
My whip be full of kids like a soccer van
Maybe be an LA like a Dodger fan
Or in Miami with all the sand
I ain't worry 'bout poppin' tags, shoppin' bags
Cleaner than a laundromat
But regular enough that walkin' past, him
No need to hide my face like a hockey mask
'Cause I be in the open with my khaki ass
Went to school but can't remember what the lessons were
I'm just high as hell, I'm so regular

[Chorus 2: Phresh Muney]
(?) dawg
'Cause I'm a regular guy
And I ain't finna make it rain, girl
'Cause I'm a regular guy
My hat big dub
I still wear chucks
I ran outta weed, man, that shit sucks
But I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm a regular guy
