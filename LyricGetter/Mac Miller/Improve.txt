[Verse 1]
Okay, I watch her sip the cyanide
Just like it's fine wine
She had her summer house in Malibu, it's high tide
Smokin' doobies, watchin' Sci-Fi movies
Make her fruit smoothies, wanna swim out to the buoys, but she terrified
Drownin' in the paradigm, singin' Sweet Sweet Caroline
The notes always been sharp though
Can you swim? No, uh, where the art go
I'm chilling with some gangsters at a horror show
A lot of pot smoke, watchin' Donnie Darko
I got a meeting schedule for tomorrow
I'll probably sleep through the alarm tone

[Pre-Chorus]
And the song goes on
And the song goes on
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
Flyin', hypnotizin', so excitin', hyp-hypnotizin'
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
So excitin', flyin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah
She still waitin' for the right one
But she never gonna meet him the night club
Clean her life up, put away the white drugs
All the dudes is all wifed up
It's a legend in the making
Modern day prophet, follow everything I'm sayin'
Never in a rush, I'm keepin' everybody waitin'
Couldn't help but laugh at the expression on their faces (Yeah)
Okay, the flow so wicked, most prolific
Trust no bitches, mind your own business
I'm so lifted, I'm oh so lifted
I don't think I'm ever comin' down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus]
And the song goes on
And the song goes on
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
Flyin', hypnotizin', so excitin', hyp-hypnotizin'
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
So excitin', flyin'
