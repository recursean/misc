[Intro]
Sour Hour, TreeJay
Most Dope, what's good?

[Verse]
I'm calm, cool, got a blunt, gonna roll up two
Don't panic, 'cause I'ma take over this planet [?] cut like a bandage
On the net, all up in your band with, no beaver
But Goddammit, this sour I smoke enhance it, got a helicopter, where should I land it?
Been searching but can't find it, the things I do is timeless
Where the fuck did this kid find this rhyme shit? Hit lime piff
Always see me chilling with a fine bitch, let her show me where her mind is
Then silence, it's private, so [?]
Want a Bentley and a big backyard, friendly but a big rap star
Still show love more bud to roll up, smoke duds so much to toke up
On a big cigar or maybe in the mood for a doob
If I roll one of these G's up, boy, you gotta roll one too
See I'm high but I'm stuck at school, don't know what the fuck to do
Uh, self-made, designed my own mind like a pair of custom shoes
So keep 'em fresh please, finna ball, 'bout to win an SB
Gretzky, unless [?] your spitting doesn't impress me
You walk but you got two left feet, drink vodka with my Pepsi
I'm drunk, you sober, I'm starting, it's over
Red Rover, Red Rover, you can't break down my wall
My hour is so sour so I ain't gonna answer calls, I'm lost
