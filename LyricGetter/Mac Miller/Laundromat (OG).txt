[Intro]
Ayo Jerm I need you to do me a favor real quick
Turn the beat up in my headphones a lil bit
This shit needs to knock a lil bit for me feel me
Ayo Cardo you keep hitting me with heat like this man
Ima have no choice but to kill it you feel me

[Verse 1]
Hey Hey I want a, bunch of bad broads, a couple fast cars
So high up in the air that I can grab mars
Got a bunch of miles in me like a gas card
King of the jungle bitch I'm Madagascar
Don't aggravate him cause I don't have the patience
Send you home early like a bad vacation
Fuck with hoes that been struck with infatuation
But I be on the road and have em waitin'
Escape from reality, life is just a fallacy
So we ride the clouds round skippin' through the galaxy
On the Millennium Falcon you see me travelin'
That's the type of shit to have you fallin' off the balance beam
Way to confusin' got they hearts movin'
Homie life is a game and you loosin'
Better start improvin', boy get your stats up
Cause my shit is gonna hit you like a mac truck bad luck

[Hook]
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
H-Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat, a-at the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

[Verse 2]
I'm puffin' lala, they got me sittin' chillin' like gaga
You grillin' at the kid but I'm laughin', haha
Now that people know me, it's so hard to stay low-key
When every single motherfucker treat me like they homie
And every single lady tell me I'm they one and only
But I'm just coverin' my ground like a zone D
Before bed I use to pray to be fresh
Now everyday I just play it's recess
It's so nice, it feels awesome
I'm just tryna ball old school Kenny Loften
Caution, address me as your sergeant
[?]I got your girl undressed at the apartment
Jameson and Hennessy, shakey with my memory
Wakin' up next to a ho that don't remember me
Hey it's so nice to meet you, but now I gotta leave you

[Hook]
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
H-Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
With my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat, a-at the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
