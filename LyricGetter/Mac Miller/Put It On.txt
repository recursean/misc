[Intro]
Ayo, Jerm
I think we got 'em here, man
Most Dope. Pittsburgh, what's good?

[Chorus]
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waiting way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waiting way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I kind of feel like I deserve this
Butterflys all up in my stomach like a first kiss
Just a word smith usin' poetry and more
But distracted by these girls who want their Juicy Couture
Yeah, this life is all about material things
I got kids tricks bitch, I'm the cereal king
And everything better if you relax and chill
So my seat back for weed naps, we need that for real
I took my heart, put it all out on a CD
You now rockin' with the bees knees
I'm the, the cat's pajamas, the coolest of the cool
The kid that got 'em gassed, tappin', usin' up their fuel
When they first heard 'em spit, didn't think that it would be shit
M-o-s-t to the d-o-p-e kids
Haven’t seen you up in ages now you hangin' with a G bitch
I want money, but they say I need Jesus

[Chorus]
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waiting way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waiting way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Flyer than a penguin, you dryer than a raisin
Hot like Cajun, bringin' all the girls to the Days Inn
Ready for a little love makin'
Yeah, I want it now but they tell me have some patience
Feeling on top of the world since graduation
Now I do music all day 'cause there ain’t no other option
Drivin' to Connecticut, then flyin' up to Boston
I put it on for my city, always showin' love
And overdosin' drugs had the people throwin' up
They say what up when I drop in
I’m just chillin' back in my seat: Joe Swanson
Yeah, I used to steal iPods and pawn them
Now I take my girl shoppin', no problem
Live it up every second, life don’t got a sequel
It’s all good, thumbs up to my people

[Chorus]
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waiting way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waiting way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
