[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah (Check me out)
That's right (Check me out)
Yeah, yeah ([?])
([?], Mac)
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
All I got for these niggas is expletives and slugs
All I got for these bitches is big dick and drugs
Alcohol and guns, don't be scared now you got it, thug
Smart enough to chill the fuck out until it's time to dump
Release so much rage in such a short space
I'll put your face in your cornflakes, mob style
You gave them Goma power, your honey want it, nigga, hold it down
Hood nigga, she love my style, I knocked the cat out, nigga
I'll pull a Lufthansa, nigga, is that your bitch?
I took that back to the casa, I'm always pulling the heist, I can't help that
Bitches wanna, to know what that ride be like for just one night
I blow up mine and get low, there's to much dough out here to be broke
So I hit the curb and bend a few corners bumping this shit here
Turnt all the way up, niggas getting robbed tonight, let's be clear
Come up off of them things, a nigga gone die tonight, I leave you here
You give me your valuables, no funny moves, I swear

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, uh
A man walked in with a smile on his face and a loaded .45 in his hand (In his hand)
Told the clerk "Don’t move, I didn't come here to shoot, but I will, so you must understand" Bang!
Shots in the air, no time to waste, been doin' drugs all day, now his mind erased (Gone)
Fuck the register, he better find the safe, get the money, hit his homies up and congregate (Uh-huh)
I need bread, my kid need to be fed, this is the recession, going through depression (Whoa)
I ain't done sinning 'cause I ain't done winning (No,) gotta be fucked up to make it to the top, where the money at?
I could be next to me, Death in Venice, work at CVS and one day you’ll manage (You'll manage)
Rejects, emotionally damaged, you kids need a shrink, let me call Rick Moranis (Okay)
Want to get a crib in Atlantis ('lantis,) knock a bitch out cold, she Rick Rambis (Whoa)
Tell Dorothy we ain't in Kansas (No,) livin' in this world, but we don't understand it (Whoa,) no
Bullshit, you can't sell that (Nope,) all these kids who get held back (Yep)
My cup filled and my L fat, thinkin', 'we just want Dave Chappelle back'
Run and tell that, I’m coming through the function [?] too disgusting for discussion (Whoa)
Yep, that's Alchemist on production, little bit Larry Fishy, it's nothing (Haha)
God vs man (Man,) lion vs lamb (Lamb,) competition ain't shit (Ain't shit)
I'ma treat you all like my bitch (My bitch,) [?] start by sucking this dick!
Biotch
*Gunshot*
