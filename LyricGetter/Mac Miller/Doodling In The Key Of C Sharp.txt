[Intro]
Check, it's 6:26 in the morning. I just made this beat 'cause I realized that I enjoy playing the piano
Ah you know, fuck you. No one is in the room with me right now so I'm gonna record myself
I'mma try and do this all in one take, so there's not a lot of editing 'cause I'm too drunk to edit. And that's just the truth of the matter
Alright, let's go

[Verse]
Uh, I said raps is cold, about 20 below
I just realized I don't give a fuck any mo'
Used to look into the mirror asking where will this go?
Got big quick, kinda wish that I was taking it slow
It takes balls to go and break from the mould, I guess I did that
I still got some dumbass fans who want K.I.D.S. back
And I forget that they twelve years old
I must accept that, should probably stop thinking so much and just rap
I wish life was kinda easier to figure out
I wish it was like Ferris Bueller singing "Twist and Shout"
I got a couple reasons that I'll stick around
But for the most part this shit is foul
I place my hand on a stovetop to see if I'm awake
I heard you taking bath salts and eating people's face
Saw the people I know personally
I see they act a certain way because they workin' for me
And if you take that as a diss it means I'm talkin' to you
Know I never look down, I got knots in my shoe-strings
Made some money, went and bought me a few things
This ain't shit I'm just doodling, haha
I'm sick of going to the movies and people looking at me
Inquire 'bout some shit that they know they shouldn't ask me
Hollywood got every girl around the world fasting
Like eating was a sin, when really beauty lie within
Guess I wouldn't fuck me a fat bitch
I just disagree wit'chu determining fat is
Wanna go to Israel and see if there's a God there
For now I'm 'bout to smoke some blunts and post in this lawn chair
Could of been the mayor 'cause I'm excellent with politicking
People never say what's on their minds because they on a mission
Who do you think you are?
And may God damn your soul if you forgot tradition
Locked inside a box, a prison, somewhere there I saw a vision
Met this girl with innocence and stole it while on top of linen
Rocket, word to Roger Clemens, that don't mean a thing
I'm in love with making melodies but scared to even sing
For you judgmental fuckheads, talking 'bout my life
You don't know me and if you did you'd say I'm nice
Everyone I see always has some cool advice
'Bout what they'd do if they were me and all the issues they would fight
You could never fathom what this shit is like
And I hope you turn your bitch to dyke
My kryptonite is me
Yeah
