[Intro: Mac Miller]
Whoop
Whoop
Ladies and gentlemen
This is Macadelic
You motherfucker, hahahaha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh
I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love, I'm like, "Bitch, you must be trippin'"
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
And it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mill' more, then a number one spot on the Billboard

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 2: Benny Banks]
I got weed up in my rizla, you can bet your life I'm smokin'
I'll be tokin' 'til I'm chokin', I'm forever puffin' potent
Take your girlfriend right up off you, go report that bitch, she stolen
I dig deep up in that pussy 'til her leg drops like Hulk Hogan's
I'm the realest ever livin', most these other rappers bogus
I got money for a mortgage, this time last year I was homeless
I get Ps, the broke don't like it, see me comin' and the rich get frightened
This is my mouth, I ain't ever gonna mind it, lost my mind, maybe I don't wanna find it
I make them hate, haters gon' hate, A-B-C, I'm all about cake
Born and raised, I ain't ever gon' change, I'll still take the food off your plate
You can call me the great white Hulk, came and I leave and I take shit home
Got her mad at me, can't do it on my own, now they gotta watch while the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Argh
I'ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team in that pack with me, hear the Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah, I got raps, tryna talk shit, what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank roll, I'ma lay low, chill, 'til I let that stack

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
