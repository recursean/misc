[Intro]
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
La-di-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, there's a room somewhere up above the trees
And once you get there, you don't ever wanna leave no-no-no, no (Ah, ah)
Feelin' good, feelin' free
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Away, away, away, away)
I need to see it with my own eyes
Hope it remembers and it knows my face, face (Ooh-ah-ooh-da-da-mm-bah)
I'll come and see you if you don't mind
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, get away
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haa
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, get away
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's a place right up above the clouds (Yeah)
Somewhere in between later and right now, right now (Right now, right now, right now)
And you don't have to be scared, no
I'll be there when I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Ooh-ah-ooh-da-da-mm-bah)
Soarin' uncontrollably, gravity ain't holdin' me down (Ha-ha), maybe I—
I'll fly to your front door some time
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Get away, get away, get away)

[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, get away
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haa
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away)
Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
