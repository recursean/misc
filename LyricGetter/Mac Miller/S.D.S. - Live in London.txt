[Intro]
Woo!
Woo!
S—somebody do somethin', please
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Whoa—oh—oh—oh
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, yeah, I said

[Verse 1]
Uh, I close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he oughta beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
Said, I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing con-cer-ete
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
So shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hating on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
Said, I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human, though, 'cause I'm so odd
If people selling drugs, they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Okay, let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan

[Chorus]
Somebody do somethin'
Said, somebody do somethin', somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Said, somebody do somethin', somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'm sippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavourin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off, leave it danglin'
FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me, said
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
Hell nah, all your songs are 16's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
Dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consuming the views of Christianity
I wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown

[Outro]
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Can somebody do somethin', please? Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Said, somebody do somethin'
Somebody, yeah, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin'
Wassup London?
Somebody
Yeah
