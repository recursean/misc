[Chorus]
Don't control yourself, this your life you own it, uh, say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment, uh, so who's coming
Don't control yourself, this your life you own it, uh, say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment, uh, so who's coming
Don't control yourself

[Verse 1]
I swear to God it's a dream come true
Everybody wonder what we gon do
Drinking a red cup pre-rolled ten blunts
When I go to sleep i don't think I'ma get up
Stay in bed to the afternoon
Ay cause you know what us rappers do
Get high get drunk then find some butt
Girl i don't wanna chase after you
Lets live it up, live it up
Party like we ain't got shit to do
I don't give a fuck, give a fuck
Nothing but cutting up with the crew

[Pre-Chorus]
My parents outta town so we gon put it down, uh
We taking shots, who can go another round

[Chorus]
Don't control yourself, this your life you own it, uh, say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment, uh, so who's coming
Don't control yourself, this your life you own it, uh, say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment, uh, so who's coming
Don't control yourself

[Verse 2]
Half awake and shit, first thing imma do is take a hit
Tonights gonna be great let's get a little drank im tryna get
Wasted bitch
This is gon be something to remember, too bad we won't, won't
And it's gonna get hot in here so, so don't bring your coat, coat
Take your clothes off we gonna get crazy
She's so defined, just borderline, but tonight she gon be my lady

[Pre-Chorus]
My parents outta town so we gon put it down, uh
We taking shots, who can go another round

[Chorus]
Don't control yourself, this your life you own it, uh, say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment, uh, so who's coming
Don't control yourself, this your life you own it, uh, say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment, uh, so who's coming
Don't control yourself
