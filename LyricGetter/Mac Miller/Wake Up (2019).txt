[Intro]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring

[Verse]
Welcome to reality
It's either this or your fatality
I am gravity, I am your majesty
I'm the truth and that's a reason that you mad at me
I'm the source of all your power, I'm your battery
I can either be the end or be your masterpiece
I can either be a friend or be a casualty
I am your addiction, you are attached to me
You try to run away, but always comin' back to me
Good and evil, I am duality
I'm the creator, I am God inside this factory
I'm blasphemy, I'm standin' on the edge
And there ain't a place I'd rather be
Yeah, you have a dream
You have a dream
But if you not ready to wake up, then go back to sleep
Open up your eyes
Yeah, you have to see
Fuck rulin' the world, I want the galaxy

[Chorus]
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin' (Wake up, wake up)
Good mornin', motherfucker (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin'  (Wake up, wake up)
Good mornin', motherfucker (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin' (Wake up, wake up)
Good mornin', motherfucker (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin' (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
