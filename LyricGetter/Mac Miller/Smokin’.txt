[Intro]
*coughing noises*
Yo TreeJ! (Aha)
Man you get me too high in here man
Ah... look
As y'all should know, 4/20 the day of smoking weed, my homie TreeJ gon' drop a mixtape named Sour Hour, so y'all can just listen to it, smoke to it, but I had to cut up on this one, you feel me? (Aha)

[Chorus 1]
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt

[Verse 1]
You seen me blow, I'm rollin' up
I'm tryna smoke
I'ma be high 'cause I don't give a fuck
Take one hit for the round, just one time for your mind
This lemon and lime, got me feeling divine, I'm way up in the sky

[Chorus 1]
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt

[Verse 2]
I'm up in the clouds
I'm not coming down
Thousands of miles in the air, and I ain't ever close to the ground
We smokin' the pounds, pounds, pounds
Breakin' it down, down, down
Just me and homies (homies)
'Til the hoes come around

[Chorus 2]
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt
I keep on smokin' up my weed
'Til I'm out of bud
Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt

[Outro]
Keep smokin', smokin', smokin', smokin' my weed
(Aight, yo)
