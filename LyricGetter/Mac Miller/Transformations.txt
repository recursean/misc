[Verse 1: Delusional Thomas]
Yeah, um alright
Okay, check, alright
Psychopathic thinker, hyper active drinker
Blew my shit up with a thumb up, like Henry Winkler
My bitch is like a king cover, put it in her sphincter
Bitch like a bad fart, all she do is linger
What, umm, let me, let me try that again
Okay, like I was saying, alright said, um
I'm psychopathic thinker, hyper active drinker
I blew my shit up with a thumb up, like Henry Winkler
My bitch is like a king cover, put it in her sphincter
Your bitch like a bad fart, all she do is linger
Shit, I should have been a singer
I should have been cursed chillin'
Would have had a sinker
Ahead of y'all chillin', you lookin' at my blinkers
Rappers is bumble bees, pullin' out your stingers
Yeah, I'm gettin' high smokin' weed again
Couple of my homies were on CNN
I change the channel once they went into commercials
Yeah, Delusional Waldo Emerson
Just like you, I love football and lesbians
Never deal with bitches, cause bitches are some thespians
Save the drama for your motherfuckin' mama
Oh Jesus, who's the rapper with the gold penis
Put away your money scrub, I ain't doin' no features
Say the motherfuckin' drill bitch I'm young Jehova
In the backyard with pads on runnin' Oklahoma's
Get low
