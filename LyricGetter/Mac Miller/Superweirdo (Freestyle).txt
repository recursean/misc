[Intro]
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Live from the battlefield
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew) (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Comes Superweirdo
(Yuh, yuh, yuh) (Woo)

[Verse]
Okay
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you? (Who the fuck are you?)
Paranoid motherfucker, I don't even trust the truth (Whoa)
This ain't the motherfuckin' Huxstables
So if my mother doin' nothin', I'ma cut her loose (Get her outta here)
I waste no time, criminal since '09
Posted on the coast line, smokin' on that (Oh my)
Everybody say I do it so (Well, well, well, well)
Young anomaly, destroyin' your Metropolis
Stand aside, I turn Rodeo Drive into the Gaza Strip (Woo)
It's the raw shit, drunk off confidence
I don't got a dealer, got an anesthesiologist (Wow)
Bitch, my shit is Artemis Fowl (Okay)
I'm standin' on the edge, they try calmin' me down
(Come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man)
They talk fast, but they listen slow (Listen slow)
There ain't a better coach around than Dick LeBeau (Whoa, whoa)

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Oh my
