[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
There is nothin' (Yeah,) to fear (Yeah, whoa-whoa-whoa)
Unless nobody is here (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
And as my head kisses my bed, it'll be a while 'til I see you again
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow, whoa)
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow, whoa)
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow, whoa)
And as my head kisses my bed, it'll be a while 'til I see her again (Don't wanna leave, whoa) (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
Girl, you're just like my pillow (Whoa)

[Refrain]
Ayy (Ayy, ayy), slow down, baby (Won't ya? Won't ya?)
Why don't you slow down, baby? (Won't ya? Won't ya?)

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
I'm havin' cold sweats, guess I'll sweat out this alcohol
Don't know which one gonna kill me, is it cocaine or adderall?
Refuse a kind gesture of sleep, pop me a Tylenol
PM, okay, I'll see you when I see you then
Stay up, late night, work late, no date nights
You give 'em hell, girl, you just like a cage fight
Always watched my health, you, cooked me them egg-whites
You can take my breath away like, just like death
You just like death, 'cause, baby, after you there really ain't shit left
I don't know what to do except try my best
I bet that I'ma hurt you just as much as the next
Man, you took a plane out to Cali' to see me
You didn't see me though
So gone, haven't seen myself in like a week or so
Oh, all the places people go
I don't sleep, I'm always dreamin' though, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There is nothin' (Yeah,) to fear (Yeah, whoa-whoa-whoa)
Unless nobody is here (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
And as my head kisses my bed, it'll be a while 'til I see you again
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow)

[Outro]
You just like (My pillow,) my pillow
You just like (My pillow)
