[Intro: Mac Miller]
Come on, oh, come on
Come on, oh, come on
Come on, oh, come on
Yeah
Oh shit

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I said
I'm posing a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother, my mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Loaded and pointed at negative energy tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, "No"
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock, praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay amaze me, that's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin', why aren't you chasin' ya dreams, uh?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn something to burn, why won't they give me a turn? L
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in a room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, [?]

[Chorus: [?]]
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', "Not today"
Life's so precious, said, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left and you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of getting ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time, bang
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you a hater I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on, homie, we major

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

[Chorus: [?]]
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Chant: Mac Miller & DJ ClockWork]
One, two, three, so throw your motherfucking
Hands up, your hands up, throw your motherfucking
Hands up (Hands up,) said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up (Get 'em up)

So throw them hands up, said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
