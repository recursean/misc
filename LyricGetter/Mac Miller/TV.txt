[Intro]
Mr. Rogers

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
When I used to be dirt broke, I couldn't afford to get a Happy Meal (Yeah)
Now it's steak and lobster, that's a make-a-player-happy meal (Yeah)
But back then, you were lookin' at me and laughin' tears (Hahaha)
Now I'm rich and you steady tryna get yo' ass up in here (Woo)
Tell me why I couldn't get a ride when I needed one
Now it's so many cars, it's like I never needed one
Allergic to bitch niggas, never see me with one
Want deeper life until Jesus Christ and his kingdom come
The same musty ass egghead sixth grader
Y'all were laughin', but he knew later, shit would get greater (Yeah)
From broke as a joke, now he's earnin' as much as six Lakers (Fire)
Save yourself, bitch, I'm savin' this paper (Haha)
I turned that green and trappin' into that black Bentley ballin' money
Always got at least fifteen stacks with me
And you can ride as long as you ain't got your hand out
Soon as you ask for somethin', that's when you get yo' ass out

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
Black car service
Had to kill myself to be here, was it all worth it?
Spent a lot of lonely nights contemplating purpose
Only did it 'cause I'm white, do I still deserve it?
Hell yeah
I put a lot of work in, thank the Lord he blessed me
First time in Houston, Bun took me to Frenchy's
I'll put a couple albums out, then they'll all forget me
But a gangster gon' always be a gangster, boy
And you don't know my past, you weren't right there wit' me
Hittin' licks to get some cash, just to buy some hash
I'm a rottweiler, top dollar, Babe Ruth, shot caller
Grand slam, head of the table, I'm the Godfather
Burn it to the ground, pickin' up the pieces
You can't save yourself when the beast is off the leashes
'Cause we comin' for you
Yeah, we comin' for you

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now?
Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn
