[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Verse 1]
Uh, look
There's just somethin' 'bout her caramel skin
And how that chest look in every single bra she in (Aha)
That got me with her every single day out the week (Uh-huh)
We don't even hit the streets, we just stay in the sheets (In the sheets)
Those brown eyes got me trapped
Kiss her on her stomach when she lie on her back (On her back)
She got class, cry and she laugh
A dime with a ass, drinking wine by the glass (Aha)
No other girl can make me hers
It's whoever wanna take me first
And she grabbed me, wouldn't let me go
Usually your heart like an Eskimo: cold
But she said there's something about me
That she don't want no loving without me
Skin so soft like I'm touching some downy
Girl, I think I'm in love

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is (Aha)
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss (Yep, yep)
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me (Me)
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Verse 2]
Look
Check my phone, always text me when she wake up
Sex is real great, always messing up her makeup (Uh)
No clothes on, lovin' to a slow song
Everybody telling us this thing we have is so wrong
And she don't care whatever goes on
Plus she's best friends with my mom (Yep)
Keep a journal, y'all know the story, though
The superficial type, love her horoscopes
And I'm a Capricorn that she ain't never had before (Nah)
Her ex hates me 'cause he ain't me, and that's for sure (Bitch)
She got this look she give that send 'em runnin'
She so stunnin', got my heart jumpin'
And my mind is all twisted
Her lips is delicious for kisses
I got her heart on my wish list
Manager: give her the business (Aha)

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love (Yep)
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love (Love)
She probably ain't in love with me (Aha)
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Outro]
So this bitch
Really hit me like, "How did you get so lucky?"
You know what I said? I said
"Bitch, how did you get so lucky?
The fuck you think this is"
Ayy, I treat my ladies right
And that's for damn sure
