[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Man, calisthenics in my head
Do I, do I get it, what's to get
Cause after a while it
Just don't seem that bad
Nothing enough till it's over
Where were you headed when I left you
Why couldn't you just wait around
And I know that after a while it
Just won't seem that bad
What should I, do for now

[Instrumental break]
It just ain't that bad

[Verse 2]
Slow down before everything change
Twenty-four seven now I say
Things are lookin' up, but I could be drunk
I just, hold onto my arm one time
If you get dizzy that's fine
Just don't get stuck and fall
Down, down, down, down
Brand new submarine
Down, down, down, down
In a brand new submarine
