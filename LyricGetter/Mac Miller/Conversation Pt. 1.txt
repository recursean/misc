[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 1]
Swear your life is basic
All you do is sit around the house, you gettin' faded
That ain't entertainment, yeah
You missin' every single shot that you ain't takin'
Hey kid, you can use a little bit of your imagination
It can do you right, improve a life you busy wastin'
Said it's your money if you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Bridge 1]
Okay, why you always hatin'?
Lacin' up my sneakers, I be runnin' out of patience
Yeah, it ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 2]
Everybody famous, everybody wild, everybody dangerous
Get a couple dollars, now they act as strangers
Now they wanna give a couple statements
When you really 'bout it, you don't say shit
Pocket full of aces
Take over my city, yeah, that's really home invasions
All my homies wit' me, gettin' busy, no vacations
They ain't on my wave but they wavin’
Stop it, boy, you runnin' through your savings

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, I just feel amazin'
My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement
Yeah, it ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feelin' good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from, who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious
