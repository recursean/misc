[Intro]
This next song right here is a song called REMember, alright?
It's dedicated to a homie of mine
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I said, I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
I admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you but
This life moves fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now, I need to run to any place with a train stop
And everybody wanna talk to me
About some business shit
Never really listening
Couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
Hate, sound the same
When my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)
Y'all holding up the lighters, I appreciate y'all man
Light up the sky for me again

[Hook]
Said I remember when we were just kids, woah-oh-oh-oh
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in West Virginia
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Said it's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go? He was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gone by by then
I said
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need
Multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place
Where the time don't end
So you don't need money
All you got is time to spend, I'm saying
Life is short, don't ever question it's length and
It's cool to cry
Don't ever question your strengths, said
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

[Bridge]
Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
So when the world's looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

[Hook: Mac & Tay Walker]
Said I remember when we were just kids woah-oh-oh
Y'all take one hand and put it real high in the air like this
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in...

Said I remember when we were just kids woah-oh-oh-oh
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about this life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
