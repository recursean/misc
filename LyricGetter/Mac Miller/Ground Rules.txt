Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woah oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, um, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Back when I use to wake up
First thing lookin' for a text sayin' "Hello baby"
And when I didn't see shit, wasn't no secret
That use to drive me crazy
I hit you on some freak shit, on some flirt shit
On some what you doin' after work shit
Can I take you out to dinner and dessert till it hurt
I'ma merk shit, I'ma merk shit, I'ma merk shit
My God, you drive
My jaw to the floor, fall apart
My squad, know all about you
I'ma let you lay down all the ground rules(Ground rules)
I'ma break, I'ma sign the cast
Numb all the pain that the mind relax
We could fuck through the day
Till we tired and passed out
It's good when the time is passed down

[Chorus]
When you're feelin' all alone
Dial that number call my phone
You could do your job from home
It ain't a race okay
We could waste today
Ground rules, ground rules, ground rules, ground rules

[Verse 2]
Keep me up night and day
Something to numb my pain
Glow like the light in space
Hurry up girl, ándale
Lets get this on the way
Put it on my tongue just taste
Think I'm gon' run away
Baby ain't no fucking way

[Chorus]
When you're feelin' all alone
Dial that number call my phone
You could do your job from home
It ain't a race okay
We could waste today
Ground rules, ground rules, ground rules, ground rules
