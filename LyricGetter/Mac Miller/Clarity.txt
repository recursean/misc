[Intro]
Clarity...
Clarity...

[Verse 1]
Clarity
Figure all this out, I ain't gonna take a charity
Marry me
Wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect
I know I love you, I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss
I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive

[Refrain]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Infatuation
When every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin'
Towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activist
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you find what you lookin' for

[Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'ma be waiting for that
I'ma be waiting for that

[Verse 3]
Misery
You represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me
I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect
From everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet
Is where my mind is, so I light another cigarette to calm me down

[Refrain]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 4]
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around
Chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between
Purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream
That's so cliché, but I can tell you what it means to me

[Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'ma be waiting for that
Said, I'ma be waiting for that
(Waiting for that)

[Outro]
