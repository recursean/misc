Said people
People
People, said people
Said people, yeah
People, yeah
Said

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
Said, what would I have to do to call you mine?
Said, someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again
Said, go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus 1]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
But I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
Oh—whoa—oh—oh—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view
Girl, you don't have to cry

[Vocalisations]

[Verse 2]
[?]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
Said, I don't expect you to be capable
Yeah, you got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
Said, I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Yeah, don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
And I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Yeah, who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

[Chorus 2]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
But I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
I said, we could change the world forever
And never come back again
And let's leave it all in the rear-view
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
Oh—whoa—oh—oh—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view
Girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
It's all in the rear-view, girl
Oh—whoa—oh—oh, oh—whoa—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view, girl
Yeah, you don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

[Vocalisations]
