[Chorus]
We are just waiting, things changin'
I've been so patient, please save me
I think one of y'all have the answers
If you would share them, amazing
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
I found a place to vacation
Inside my hallucination
Let's talk, just a conversation
Tell me what got you frustrated?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, lily pads on the water
Um, rose petals on the ground
Yeah, I been prayin' to the Father
He, pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, think fast or don't think at all
I, drown my sorrows in the alcohol
I- I been lookin' for a job
But there ain't shit around, so I'm leavin' this town tomorrow
With a backpack full of dreams
Bunch of bad bitches that audition for the team
Yeah, she said she could've been a queen
If papa was a doctor and mama wasn't a fiend
In that case, I coulda been a genius
I'ma start livin' as soon as I find a reason
Yeah, it's a cycle of seasons
Life would be good if Michael was still breathin'
Yeah, God bless the dead
Give me the strength to find sleep when I rest my head
Catch my breath, sex with equestrians
'Cause God ain't shit but a pedestrian
Yeah, lessons learned and words ignored
Stomp your feet, it hurts the floor
The idea was mine, but the words were yours
Baby girl, said the world is yours

[Chorus]
We are just waiting, things changin'
I've been so patient, please save me
I think one of y'all have the answers
If you would share them, amazing
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
I found a place to vacation
Inside my hallucination
Let's talk, just a conversation
Tell me what got you frustrated?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?

[Refrain]
Love is a miracle, my love
Love is a miracle, my love
Love is a miracle, my love
Love is a miracle, my love
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well, drownin' in the universe around us
We were far away, never found us
I been thinkin', drinkin', thinkin', doin'
Life is so much more, let's keep it movin'
Look at all the dreams that we pursuin'
Step into my life and leave it ruined
Freedom sings a song, it's out of tune
And, try to follow along
They, told us a lot of rules, all of them wrong
She don't love you no more, then you got to move on
Hold on to them lies she tells
How have you been, can you find yourself?
Lost in equation, a lot of frustration
Mind racin', time wastin', I’m facin'
Yeah, this a mirror with a fist up
Right trigger, A-B, uppercut, kick, punch

[Chorus]
We are just waiting, things changin'
I've been so patient, please save me
I think one of y'all have the answers
If you would share them, amazing
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
I found a place to vacation
Inside my hallucination
Let's talk, just a conversation
Tell me what got you frustrated?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Do you believe in love?
