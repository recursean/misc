[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So whaddup cousin

[Verse 1]
How you been, homie?
What it is, homie?
Without you here, your family feel lonely
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on
Although it seems so unfair you're gone
People nowadays never focus on the positives
Cause life now only good when the guap is big
They talkin' shit, hatin' for no reason
And haters is stupid
Baby my flow, leave 'em
So confused cause they all up 'bout this dumb shit
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubish
So I'ma make my time here worth it, real god for you
Lookin' back like there's nothin' I couldn't do
And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart and soul singin' rap
I've been thinkin' that I found my passion
Rappin' 'bout the future in an old-school fashion

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So whaddup cousin

[Verse 2]
They say my style ain't different
I'm just like e'ry body else
They say my pitches gotta change up
But all those people is just hatin' cause they don't know how to love theyself
Mad when someone bring my name up
And it's unfortunate cause I'm just here comin' from the heart, shit
I'm just tryna find somethin' for the market
And I ain't sayin' that I'm from the worst hardships
But my life ain't no walk in the park, it's been a shark pit, dark with no harvest
Drivin' in a car but can't find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to ball with
That musta been what got this shit started
There's been some people that I hadn't said goodbye to
But my life gotta go on, and it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, that's why I wrote this fuckin' song

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So whaddup cousin

[Verse 3]
Shit's real out there, ain't nobody playin' round
I got some bangers and some druggies that I hang around
E'ry body do they own thing
And you can find me on the corner makin' money when it's snowin'
I sell a lil' weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who be movin' lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, it's just makin' the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down and move into the lab
That's how much I want this music shit to last
And some days I feel it's movin' too fast
Schools gone pass, not rememberin' a class
Suddenly before you know it's time to grow up
Focus on the real, try not to get ya hopes up
So far I've had some hard work and a lil' luck
Once I make it to the money, I ain't gone give it up

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So whaddup cousin
