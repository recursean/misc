[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
She breaks down the pain
Yeah

[Verse 1]
She breaks down the pain, she rolls up the weed
She far from a saint, she's all that I need
She lost in her thoughts, so hardly she speaks
Her mind's always dirty and her soul's never free (Woah-woah)
She never been a groupie (No Way)
She just in love with the music
She watch depressin' movies (Always)
Something from the 30's or the 40's about a dependent house wife (Woah-woah)
She makes up her bed like she makes up her stories
Awake through the night, then she high from the mornin'
I wish she could feel me, she never felt nothing
Knock on her door, she let me come in

[Chorus]
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
'Cause swear to God, Heaven feels just like home
Let's go home, yeah

[Verse 2]
And the water, it's shallow like the lies that she tells
Can't run from your shadow, can't hide from yourself
She hates that she cries when she's all by herself
And she's always all by herself (Woah-woah)
She hardly talks in conversation (No way)
But, but when she do, all the words get lost in translation (Always)
No she can't move (Woah-woah-woah)
Cause she paralyzed from the fear that she fantasized
The doctor tried to analyze they can not find
Anything that's wrong with her
Her parents never got along with her
I had to make this song for her

[Chorus]
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
'Cause swear to God, Heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
'Cause swear to God, Heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
'Cause swear to God, Heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
