[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mama don't cry no more, I'm comin' home
I'm not like you, could I be
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Can you give me your problems please
I'll take them with me and leave mine at home

[Verse 1]
Have you met someone as crazy as me, I'll wait, you'll see
Swear to God the studio should pay me to leave
God damn I tried, I tried, told the truth and I lied
Lord knows that I've been foolish
You mistakin' me for human one too many times, yeah
You gettin' no more emotion from me, gimmie anybody who
Still believes that their dreams, can come true
I guess, I'll take your ignorant too, and I'll teach
And we'll see, and the rest you can keep, I don't need it

[Chorus]
I'm not like you, could I be
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Said can you give me your problems please
So I can leave mine at home

[Verse 2]
I'll be the first one to admit, sex been kind to me
Would I give it all back for just a crack of the goodnight sleep
Set the table for me, sorry I can't eat
It's easy to lie, you think I got places to be
Shit, I spend so much time, tryna to relax my mind
You spend everyday on your feet, why can't you see that

[Chorus]
I'm not like you, could I be
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Can you give me your problems please
I'll take them with me and leave mine at home
Yeah, could I be
Said Mama don't cry no more, I'm comin' home
