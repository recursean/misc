[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
These motherfuckers don't know
These motherfuckers don't know, yeah

[Verse 1]
The tracklist filled up with so many mistakes, can't believe I'm alive
Will you be a saint or a sinner? Whatever you want, you decide
All day I been faded, all day I been faded, but fuck it, I drive
Now I'm in a Mercedes, a pill made me crazy, today I could die
Fall asleep in the pussy, wake up to the money, my life a clich√©
I think I deserve a promotion, I think I'ma need me a raise
Tell these motherfuckers "Keep playin'"
'Cause me I created the game though
Stack my money and lay low, they can't fuck with my bankroll

[Chorus]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one

[Open Verse]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, (Okay, okay, okay, okay) yeah
I get up with the sun, only sleep for a minute
Then back to the grind (Woo)
They party and bullshit, get wasted, I done it
Ain't wastin' my time (No, no)
I'm faded, my eyes low, so no reason to hide that I'm blatantly high
Bitches been trippin' since in the beginnin'
Don't listen every time they tellin' me lies, oh no (Oh, no)
All I ever wanted, was to be somebody special
Couple diamonds dancin' on the dental
Cap in mind, don't mind though by the elbow, yeah, you know
Know you poppin', when you make a million dollars on the cellphone (Huh?)
Money been a manifesto, said, the money been a manifesto, yeah
I'm up like espresso, the bitches say "hello"
I'm outta' the friendzone (Woo)
I rode with the homies, where ever we go
We don't follow no dress code (Nah)
And I'm still young, gettin' faded to feel numb

[Chorus]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one, yeah

[Outro]
