Said I
Hit the blunt in the whip
Turn this up with the bitch in the front
And a fifth, I'm a sip
'til I'm sick and I'm drunk
I ain't giving a fuck, yeah
I been in the front
Now I live like a pimp with the business stuff(?)
The chicks and the tricks make the bitch just peel
Like her boyfriend coming, do the gang(?) pay up
Like the first of the month
Take what I want
Everybody needs some yeah
This how it supposed to be
How a mafuckah supposed to be
And a god gunna shine...
