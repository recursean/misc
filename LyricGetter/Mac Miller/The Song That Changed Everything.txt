[Verse 1: SZA]
I love when you smell like your car
Smell like you've been driving for days
You ain't even stop for gas, my nigga
Missed the postman
Is you drivin' to me?
Is you drivin' 'cross the country?
You've been up for three days with one nap
I know you miss the nighttime
I know you miss your lifetime
Tell me the truth about it
Tell me the truth about it
Tell us the truth about it
Cocaine is ruthless
I know the truth about it
Cocaine is ruthless

[Instrumental Break]
