Yeah
Yeah
Should probably start drinkin' more water

[Verse 1]
Yeah I was
Sittin' in the basement
I just need a little motivation
Or a vacation, maybe just a little bit of patience
Made a couple million what the fuck I'm still waitin' for
This American hallucination, yeah
Wake up this American hallucination
Well, I feel liberated
Fuck feelin' famous
Especially when you don't fuck with how the picture painted
Livin' in the matrix, digital ages
Can't believe this shit everybody get away with
Yeah, and you call this shit sacred yeah
Well, the opinion unpopular
Sittin' here zonin' to the image on the monitor
Young piece of shit, I'm from the Burg though
Shadow lounge birthed the legend, no award show needed
But I can tell you what the kids like
Feelin' when you little but the feelin' really big like
No, I never been the bitch type
Always down to give a little insight
I put it all in the music and live life
Hopin' that I did it right
Put it all in the music and live life
Fucked up, self destruct that's kryptonite
We already move that dope
Bout time to hit the road, go and do them shows
Get yourself a real woman, go and lose them hoes
Little chicken noodle soup for the soul
Yeah, it's all good
6:30 in the morning
And it's all good
6:30 in the morning
Wake up, it's all good
6:30 in the morning
And it's, all good
Yeah
I am who I hate but fuck that
Gettin' throat, she'll never know if I come back
Shit was all good when I loved rap
Finna had me screamin' where the drugs at
The most hated, all I know is greatness
Home run, laps round the bases
Have a little fun, makes faces
Make money, make changes
