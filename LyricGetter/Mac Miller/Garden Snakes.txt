[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Yeah, umm, yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the free mind
I pick you up from times, got feelin on a decline
Now we the giants, fee-fi
Just had to get some me time
Bitch I ain't no average-Joe, I'm motherfuckin' G.I
The weak spine can go to hell
I'm overwhelmed, can't even pick the car I want to drive
Often times, we fear the disappointment from our fathers eyes
Far cry to heaven, longer ride back home
Unconnect, a mind felon, never talk on phones
And fuck regret, we the legends when we hot or cold
I'm old fashioned, very closed, and polkadot my soul, yeah
I made adjustments, I'm just gettin' started
Why the fuck I feel like brushin', like a sweep, or a snare roll
How do I bare the way to those I can't know
Give light like a lamp post, and fix me up a hand rolled
Everybody clap your hands for-
The Wizard and the Tinman, and the Lion and the Scarecrow

[Chorus]
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in
Have a glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, There's snakes in the grass

[Verse 2]
I hate the power she got over me
I'm Bukowski writin' poetry
Hold on to imaginary rosaries
Put away your own beliefs
Guess we ain't the same
But we all came from motherearth's ovaries
Rabid dog show my teeth
Eat a motherfucker whole
Chewin' on your crunchy bones
Spit out your disgusting soul
Homie we don't love them hoes, yes we do, but fuck 'em though
Tell the doctor that my medicine can probably up the dose
I'm not there, but fucking close
Oh my god I'm fucking close
Bitch you ain't no fucking judge
But this my blood, I'm under oath
Shit I guess it's just the way it goes, yeah
Better go and smell the roses, if you wanna' tell the world about 'em
I'm in my imagination, there's a world around 'em
And when they hatin', eliminate 'em like you never knew 'em
Save me from my execution

[Chorus]
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in
Have that glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, there's snakes in the grass
