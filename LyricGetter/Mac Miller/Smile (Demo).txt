[Verse 1]
Still can't seem to figure out
What happens in my head
Thought alone is gonna kill me
Sick of livin’ with this doubt
This pistol in my hand
I could end it all before the mornin'
Summertime always gon' come around
I’ll be waitin' for another smile
Devil, lift my feet off the ground
Tryna hold on, but gravity won't let me go
This gravity won't let me go
Whoa, whoa
This gravity won't let me go

[Verse 2]
The devil always smile when you need a friend
I'm layin' on this cloud
It's a long drive back to earth
Wonder when my happy days will fade away
Don’t rain on my parade
If it’s only for this moment
So gravity let me go
So can you please let me go?
Let me go, oh (Whoa)
Will you let me get higher, higher?
I just wanna get higher, higher
Wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Let me get higher
I wanna get high
Said I wanna get high
(Yeah, yeah-eh-eh)
(Yeah, eh-eh)
(Yeah, eh-eh)
Gravity, can you let me go?
