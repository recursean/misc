[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
She  chase a high that she'll never reach
Waste  her time with that ketamine
In her mind, it'll set her free
Why won't they let her breath?
That  numbness‚ there ain't nothing like that numbness
That  feeling she in love with‚ let it go and say fuck it‚ yeah (fuck it)
Fighting with her mom, hard to get along
Everything  that you ever do is wrong, things got complicated
She want to walk away (walk away)‚ helps on the way
Turn the funeral to a holiday (to a holiday)
All the pain, the tear drops fall on her face
Like  waterfalls (like waterfalls), just like waterfalls (just like waterfalls)
She wants to be forgotten‚ lonely way too often
She can't stop it all (stop it all)
As her conscious fade away, colors fade to grey
She the hate day, can't sleep at night
In her dreams she might just be alright
If she drops it all, if she drops it all

[Chorus]
Run, run
Chase them waterfalls, them waterfalls
Run, run
This seems impossible, impossible

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
She can't remember the last time that she smiled
No company around, she need somebody now
Mom was never proud, dad was never that interested
He was always outta town, scared she gonna drown
In them waterfalls, in them waterfalls
She better off alone, nobody ever notice that she don't talk at all
Yeah, it ain't nothing like the old days
That pain resemblin' cold rain
She locked away in her own space
Got introduced to that cocaine and forgot it at all
Shouldn't have gotten' involved

[Chorus]
Run, run
Chase them waterfalls, them waterfalls
Run, run
This seems impossible, impossible

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Chase them waterfalls, them waterfalls
Chase them waterfalls, them waterfalls
Chase them waterfalls
