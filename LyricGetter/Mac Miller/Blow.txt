[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah, yeah
Good mornin' (Mornin', mornin')

[Verse 1]
Yeah, wake up in God we trust
I pour some liquor in my coffee cup, I roll the weed and spark it up
This sober life is not for us, it's all because I got's to bust
Like havin' sex with Playmates
She wanna have some lunch tomorrow, can't afford my day rate
(Well, well, well)
No apologies, it's me, my money and astronomy
I wake up like this crazy life might kill me
I'm tryna to change the world, they busy tryna take a selfie
I'm so deep inside this hole
There's no one down enough to help me
Other than Hell, I be's the hottest
But I make it snow in August, don't proceed with caution
Loose cannon, Hulk shit, I'm Bruce Banner (Banner, Banner)
The way the music hit you like the room dancin'
Me and my dawgs, we hungry, must be a huge famine
Crib in the Hampton's, one right out in Malibu
Pays to be an artist, it all started on Penn Ave
Yeah, the volume up, the sound is drownin' you (Drownin' you, drownin' you)
I just gotta lay back and (And, and, and)

[Chorus]
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
Find the shit I'm tryna say, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
I pray to God he help me find my way, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
In the whip, I almost hydroplaned, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah
I pray to God she help me find my way

[Verse 2]
Yeah, before I started, regarded as one of the hardest in the yard
No money from a job, I was distracted by these broads
She said, "You want that pussy? Then walk the plank," and
I dove into that ocean, I saw her naked in the Hall of Angels
Chasin' lion, tigers, caught a Bengal
Best finagle the bagel, ready, willin', and able
Fillin' ya cable with destructions, spontaneous combustion
Alien abductions, plus what the fucks in
Platinum plus rappers
Say "Hi" when you see me, won't be say nothing after
I'm a motherfuckin' bastard, uh
Master of disguise, word to the wise, don't fuck with me
You the rich and comfortably, we out back, dungaree
Motherfucker please don't even think to try me
My mind is somewhere else, they pumpin' "crazy" in my IV, yeah
You either with me or behind me, from up here the world look tiny, shit

[Chorus]
I roll some weed and blow my mind away
Find the shit I'm tryna say, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away
I pray to God he help me find my way, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away, yeah
In the whip, I almost hydroplaned, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away, yeah
I pray to God she help me find my way (Way, way, way, way)
