[Verse 1]
Everybody love it cause we do it with ease
Hop up online get your music for free
The blog is hot it's no longer on the down low
A song side if it get a lot of downloads
Everybody love it cause right before a hit drop
Already grabbed it off hot new hip hop
Blog is like the shit talk coming at your neck
Cause fake shit coming well it doesn't get respect
Blog's hit the net like a mufucking typhoon
Nobody dropping dollars on iTunes
Websites good to look at like a hot mom
Rap mullet allhiphop.com
A lot of hate on hip hop game
Dudes like damn white boy is lame
But it's great cause i love hate
So listen fuck face
I'm giving news, hip-hop updates
You want music? And all that fly?
You better do it like motor and blog or die
If you searching you'll come across sermon
Cuttin' up more than your everyday person
And some blogs makin' no noise
While others be putting up them two dope boys
We all rap and getting long cash
Putting hip hop on smash
Exclusives, pictures, everyone can see me
From DC to BC, bio page read me
See the kid rock punchlines fist pop
And my first stops hip hop
Yeah, i keep the scene fresh hip hop dx
Sometimes i wonder what this music gon' be next
V-necks to baggy clothes
Blowing like alamo
Check the blogs you can see the youngin has the flow
Balls like cockfights, jaws like dog bites
Daily check up or nah, right?
And i see dope, got me three phones
I leak tracks like leak jones
So check how im ripping you
You other cats is pitiful
From east coast to the midwest digital
Bars like cells and im armed well, yeah
With new music in my cartel
I like the cigarette, check your mr x, yeah
See this life is just living deaf
I got splash and lowkey heard that new
Oh new mac miller yeah i heard that too
So if i forgot to say your blog and you're showing love
Im so high you can blame it on the bud

But i love all yall man
Good luck everybody
Keep putting up that free music
And post my shit, damn!
