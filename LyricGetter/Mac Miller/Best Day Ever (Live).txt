[Intro: Mac Miller & Tay Walker]

Mac:
Hey, um
Taylor
Hey man I appreciate you guys coming out here
And-and-and bringing the live music aspect to my set

Tay:
I know

Mac:
And-and I know we usually do new shit
But I feel like I got some fans in here that would appreciate if we could just do some old shit real quick

Tay:
I don’t, I don’t know
In my country
In my country we don’t do old shit, no

Mac:
I-I understand baby
But just ask them
You mind change—
Just ask them, ask them

Tay:
I don’t—
Do you, do you guys want to do the old shit?
[Crowd cheers]
Oh my God, that is it
We’re doing it
We’re doing it
That is it I don’t care, we are doing it
I don’t—

Mac:
Ok
Alright you remember the one I was telling you about on a spiritual journey
The one song that came to me and told me
“Hey man you could do this. You can be a human being if you just try.”
Remember that one?

Tay:
Yes

Mac:
Lets do that one

Tay:
Lets do it

[Verse 1]

Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say
I said
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe
Let me hear y'all sing this shit with me!
You ready?
Let's go!

[Hook: Mac & Crowd]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
Sing!
Sing!
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
Woo!

[Verse 2]
Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say
And if it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
Nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own, said
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Let me hear y'all sing this shit!

[Hook: Mac & Crowd]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be--- happy, only laughing like a child
I can't hear you!
I never thought life would be this sweet
I can't hear you!
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
