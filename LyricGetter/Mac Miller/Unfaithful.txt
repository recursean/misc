[Intro: Ron Browz]
It's your boy, Ron Browz, aka the Ether Boy. Shoutout to Mynd Tek

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sample]
Faithful to the end
She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend, aha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, look
She say I'm just a player like Punisher was
A bunch of old girls that I swept under the rug
So before you shut me out, first let me explain
'Cause I'ma keep you warm when the temperature change
And I'll try my best to stay true (Stay true)
I really hope that I can stay faithful (Yep)
'Cause you the type of girl that I prayed for (Prayed for)
I'ma wait outside for you when the rain pour
Here's my crib, let's take a tour
You layin' on my bed like you gon' make it yours (Aha)
You taste sweet like a peach when we deep in the sheets
When I leave I'ma try my best not to cheat
'Cause never would I lie, deceit you (Nah)
I wanna be the other half that completes you (Yep)
Not only fuckin' but goin' out to eat too (Syke)
I was prayin' that I would meet you (Aha)

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sample]
Faithful to the end
(What?) She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Let's go, look
Man, you know the ways of the rap world (Rap world)
I don't even have to holler at girls
They just approach me, tellin' me they know me
It's all just a circle like Ring Around the Rosie (Yep)
So I don't listen to hoes
I just smile, laugh, let 'em hit up my bros
'Cause I love it when you kiss me on the tip of your toes
When I take you out, you know I'm bringin' a rose, and
It's apparent, you can meet my parents (Wassup?)
Mark and Karen, let's try not to scare 'em
And I'm recording this with a smile
Pick up the dial 'cause I ain't seen you in a while (What's up, baby?)
Hard to believe it's true
But right now all I want is you (Is you)
So, baby, you can holler at me
Forget about your pops, you can call me daddy ([?])

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Sample]
Faithful to the end
She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend
