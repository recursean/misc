[Intro: Mac Miller]
Whoop!
Had to throw one of those in there, uhhh
This that, motherfuckin' millionaire music, ya feel me?
Chyah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch (Whoop!)
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (Let's go)
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And a girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (Whoop!)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, so I just bought another Rollie and that shit is Goldie Hawn
Better get it before it's gone 'cause my shop been open long
I stay smokin' on that strong, I'm smokin' on that strong
Then go and take a handful of drugs, what the fuck is goin' on? (Whoop!)
Bein' rich? Well that's fun as hell
These bitches come like they under spells
Yo Mr. Jobs, you see I'm a Mac
But I'm rollin' deep like Adele
I'm Robert Downey Jr., you more like Steve Carell
So get smart, no head starts, put a lion on a gazelle
You tryna rhyme 'cause you idolize what I design for myself
But it's hard to find these bars of mine so Columbine yourself
I don't hate ya bitch, just fakin' rich
I get paper like grades at Cambridge
I'm best friends with my banker, shit
Gave her fifty racks just to make a wish
Brand new crib, I'm paintin' it
Half a mil, just paid for it
No Thanksgiving Parade in this
But we marchin' like the Saint's came in
So run and hide, eyes open wide 'cause this gon' be your jam
Just burn a dutch and turn it up as I pass it off to Cam, damn

[Chorus: Cam'ron & Mac Miller]
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Yo, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And a girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant
Uh, I got that Mac with me

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo, we never met before but there'll be a mess for sure
When I was a baby, my crib was Mom's dresser drawer (Yep)
Infrared, blastin' guns, duckin' shots
Another K, another tank, another Glock
They smokin' weed, shippin' E, crushin' rocks
Forget the Porsche, they want your baby mother boxed
And you pamper honey, word, he pamper honey
And she suckin' dick for formula and Pamper money (Damn)
And a real thug don't play that
Laid back where the Mac and the K at
Yayo turned to the straight crack
Maybach black with a gat, won't say jack
Say jack, say jack, say jack, say jack
Say jack, say jack, I got that Mac with me

[Chorus: Cam'ron & Mac Miller]
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
This ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And a girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant
Uh, I got that Mac with me

[Outro: Female Voice]
