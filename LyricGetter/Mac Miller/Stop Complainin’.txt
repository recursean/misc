[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' (yeah)
I've been laying 'round like your everyday person (yep)
Homie, I've been chillin' (chillin')
Tryin' stay grounded (grounded)
Made too much money, ain't got no time to count it (no prob)
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options (no)
Is life really that bad?
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad?
Stop complainin'
Is your life really that bad?
Yeah, everyday we survive, mane
Is your life really that bad? (hell no!)
Keep waiting, let them never stop hatin' on ya
If it is lemme know (yeah!)
Gotta get up off your ass
Everybody gotta go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the infinite bullshit, it doesn't end (no)
I'm amongst my friends, swagger on a hundred-ten (ooh!)
It's feeling like, fallin' in love again
I made that money, money— musta learned somethin' then (well)
Not really, no— I don't give a fuck again
Bottom of the ninth inning, bring the closer from the pen (Shut it down!)
Pittsburgh soldier, see the war's never over
Wake 'em up like Folgers, thought I motherfuckin' told ya
I'm the faces on the poster in your sister's room
While she doing homework probably sniffin' glue
Reason that she missin' school
Parents disapprove of the lyrical content
Wish I focused I more on the issues, less material objects (god damn)
My spiritual conscious is delirious often
Went from always livin' life to disappeared in a coffin
I'm a vampire, zombie child
All the walls fallin' down
Didn't pay attention to me, you don't have an option now
Karma brought the commas round
Line em up and knock em down
Bitch, I've been the hottest out
I became a monster
Now I whistle they shoot missiles that could bring a helicopter down
In way over my head, I'm tryin' not to drown (HELP!)
Married to the game but made her cop the gown
Put it on, she dropped it down
Fucked the shit up doggy style (yeah)
I let it go though, that's a lot for now
Okay

[Chorus]
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' (yeah)
I've been laying 'round like your everyday person (yep)
Homie, I've been chillin' (chillin')
Tryin' stay grounded (grounded)
Made too much money, ain't got no time to count it (no prob)
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options (okay)
Is life really that bad?
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad?
(Why you mad though?)
Stop complainin'
Is your life really that bad?
Yeah, everyday we survive, mane
Is your life really that bad?
(Why you mad though?)
Keep waiting, let them never stop hatin' on ya
If it is lemme know (lemme know!)
Gotta get up off your ass
Everybody gotta go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the flow is timeless
I don't got time for all these sensitive vaginas
Either catch up or get behind it
The highest climate hot, probably melt your finest diamonds
Everybody got something to say, just get in line with Simon
You call your momma tell her ain't done droppin' bombs
Finished shit with Donald Trump, probably down to call Ivana
Man, I'm the man, bet you wanna
Now I see a shrink cause even kings, they need a doctor
When they sick wit it, ride wit a pimp, bitch, I'm Xzibit (indeed)
Dimwitted, old Jewish spit kidders still ain't finished, paint drippin'
Nah, I ain't God, but I came with him, pain in 'em
Homie, I was blind before I gained vision (vision)
Went from hell to heaven, shit, I changed prisons
Motherfuckers whinin' like Jerry when Elaine trippin'
Shit, it's the Pennsylvania friendly neighbor
Bars gettin' served like a tennis player
Order an extra waiter wit' it
Never let the pressure break you wit' it
Oh, life, what a monster that it makes you wit' it
God, this a cause for celebration
I know heaven's waitin' but this music shit is elevation

[Chorus]
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' (workin')
I've been laying 'round like your everyday person (person)
Homie, I've been chillin' (chillin')
Tryin' stay grounded
Made too much money, ain't got no time to count it (no prob)
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options (okay)
Is life really that bad? (not really)
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad? (hell no!)
Stop complainin'
Is your life really that bad?
Yeah, everyday we survive, mane
Is your life really that bad?
Keep waiting, let them never stop hatin' on ya
If it is lemme know
Gotta get up off your ass
Everybody gotta go

[Outro]
Whoo!
Good mornin'
No prob!
Yeah, that's all I got for now
Takin' notes, jot it down
Cause the paper longer than the Gotti trial
Take it all, leave it dryer than a water drought
