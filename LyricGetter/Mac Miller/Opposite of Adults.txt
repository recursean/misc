[Intro]
Cali Kush, it's fantastic
Uh
I'm too high to think of something to say in the intro
I'll think of something later
Aha, hey

[Chorus]
Don't control yourself
This your life
You own it, uh
Said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is
This moment, uh
So who's coming?
Don't control yourself
This your life
You own it, uh
Said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is
This moment, uh
So who's coming? Don't control yourself

[Verse 1]
Aha, uh
I swear to God, this a dream come true
Everybody wonder what we gon' do
Drink in the red cup, pre-rolled 10 blunts
When I go to sleep I don't think I'ma get up
Stay in bed till the afternoon
Ayy, 'cause you know what us rappers do
Get high, get drunk, then find some butt
Girl, I don't wanna chase after you
Let's live it up, live it up
Party like we ain't got shit to do
I don't give a fuck, give a fuck
Nothin' but cuttin' up with the crew
My parents outta town, so
We gon' put it down, uh
We takin' shots
Who can go another round? (Hey)

[Chorus]
Don't control yourself
This your life
You own it, uh
Said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is
This moment, uh
So who's coming?
Don't control yourself
This your life
You own it, uh
Said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is
This moment, uh
So who's coming? Don't control yourself

[Verse 2]
Hey
[?] wake, and shit
First thing I'ma do is take a hit
Tonight's gonna be great, let's get
A little drink, I'm tryna get wasted, bitch
This gonna be somethin' to remember
Too bad we won't, won't
And it's gonna get hot in here, so
Don't bring your coat, coat
Take your clothes off
We gonna get crazy
She's sorta fine, just borderline
But tonight she gon' be my lady

[Refrain]
My parents outta town, so
We gon' put it down, uh
We takin' shots
Who can go another round? (Hey)

[Chorus]
Don't control yourself
This your life
You own it, uh
Said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is
This moment, uh
So who's coming?
Don't control yourself
This your life
You own it, uh
Said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is
This moment, uh
So who's coming? Don't control yourself

[Outro]
We out in Cali, right now
