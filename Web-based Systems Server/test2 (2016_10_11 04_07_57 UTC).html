<h1>HTML 5</h1>

<img src="HTML5_Logo_32.png" alt="HTML5 logo" />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Successor to both HTML 4 and XHTML 1</li>
  <li>Immediate goals (see the W3C's <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/html-pressrelease">W3C Relaunches HTML
    Activity</a> and <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/vision.html">Architectural vision behind
    the HTML/XHTML2/Forms Chartering</a>): 
    <ul>
      <li>Add new language features so that web page authors will want to adopt
        the new language and web browser developers will therefore want to
        support it</li>
      <li>Support both HTML and XML as different <em>serializations</em> of a
        single underlying language</li>
      <li>Design the language and serializations so that it is relatively easy
        to convert automatically between the serializations, e.g., so that a
        document that works well in a browser can be readily converted for
        processing by XML software</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longer-term goal 
    <ul>
      <li>Increase percentage of browser pages that are either written in XML
        or easily transformable into XML</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
