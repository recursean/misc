The PNG files in this directory represent playing cards.

All images are 71(w)x96(h) pixels.

back.png is a card back image.  All other images are card fronts.

jokb.png and jokr.png are black and red jokers, respectively.

For all other cards, the file name consists of the card number
(2 through 10, (j)ack, (q)ueen, (k)ing, (a)ce) followed by the
card suit ((c)lub, (d)iamond, (h)eart, (s)pade).

The CardGen program generated all non-joker card fronts.

After running CardGen, some card fronts were hand-modified as follows:

- Added images to centers of face cards (jack, queen, king)
- Added fancy ace image to center of ace of spades.

WARNING: running CardGen will overwrite all non-joker card front files,
destroying the existing hand-drawn images.
